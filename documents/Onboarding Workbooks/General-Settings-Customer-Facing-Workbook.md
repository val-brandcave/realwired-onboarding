General Settings: Workbook
What are they?
General Settings are various system settings that enable or disable certain functionalities within YouConnect.
## Configuration:
## Default Filters by Request Status – “Not Submitted” Orders:
Statement: By default, the system displays “Submitted” and “In Progress” orders each time you click on the Requests tab. For Job Managers and Bank Admins, you can decide if “Not Submitted” orders will also be displayed by default.
Question(s): Would you like to make “Not Submitted” orders visible to Job Managers and Bank Admins by default under the Requests tab.
Additional Information: This setting only applies to orders created within YouConnect (no Glances option)

## Parcel Number Format:
Statement: If using Parcel Number on Property Record, we have the ability to have two additional fields for State and County exposed and associated with each Parcel # entry.
Question(s): Would you like to add these two additional fields for State and County?
Additional Information: Property Address already has State and County, so may be redundant unless you often see multiple state/counties for your Parcel #s.

## Additional Vendor Fee:
Statement: If the YouConnect system fee is a percentage of the vendor fee, we have the ability to include the YouConnect Fee within the Vendor “Fee Quotes” and “Totals” displayed on the Vendor Bid Response panel and the request.
Question(s): Would you like the Vendor Fee Quotes and Total Fees displayed within a request to include the System Fee?

Default Setting for “My Items” (Bank Admins)
Statement: This setting controls if “My Items” will be checked by default for all Bank Admins on the Requests tab search filters.
Question(s): Would you like all Bank Admins to see only the work they’re associated with by default upon initial log in, or do you want them to see all orders (any Job Manager or Bank Admin can uncheck My Items to see all orders).

Department Filters on Searches
Statement: If orders will be filtered and processed by different departments (ie. Appraisal Dept. vs Environmental Dept.), the filter will highlight the Request Types based on the department the Request Type is assigned to (Appraisal or Environmental Department). An example would be if you are in the Environmental Department when you initially log in only Environmental request types will be highlighted and displayed in the request list view. The user can clear that filtered search to be able to see all request types.
Question(s): Would you like your JMs to see all requests or just the requests within their department by default?

Estimated Total Completion Date
Statement: The estimated total completion date is a field that takes the expected report delivery date and the # of days to complete the Review (if known) to be displayed to the lender. If those dates change, so does the Estimated Total Completion Date which triggers and email notification to the lender to always keep them apprised of the status of the request. You can also manually update this field if desired, which will trigger an email notification to the lenders.
Question(s): Would you like to enable this feature and associated fields?

Enable Edit for “On Hold” Requests
Statement: When a request is on hold, edits cannot be made to the request.
Question(s): Would you like JMs and/or Bank Admins to be able to edit requests that are on hold?
Additional Information: Comments and Documents can be added while on hold by lenders or Job Managers.

Enable Review Approval
Statement: Review Approval is a feature that allows a Job Manager or Reviewer to send a request for review to another Job Manager or Review prior to completing the order.  It is an optional action prior to request completion.
Question(s): Would you like to enable this feature?


Review Due Date – Require at Review Acceptance (Internal Reviews Only)
Statement: If enabled, this setting requires Reviewers to enter a “Review Due Date” in a popup that appears when they select “Accept for Review.”
Question(s): Would you like to enable this feature?
Recommendation:  Enable – ensures field is populated

## Forbid Edit to Loan Officers (Request/Property) once JM Accepts the Request:
Statement: If enabled, this setting prevents LOs from being able to (1) Edit a Request after a JM has accepted it, and (2) Edit a Property record if there is a Request In Progress associated with it.
Question(s): Would you like to impose these limitations to your LOs?
Recommendation: Enable – best practice

## Always Show Report Panels to LOs:
Statement: By default, the Report Submission and Request Review panels (as well as uploaded Reports and Reviews) are hidden from LOs until a Request is marked as Completed.
Question(s): Would you like your Lenders to see these panels as well as the vendor reports and reviews as soon as they’re uploaded, regardless of status instead?
Additional Information: As needed, a JM can manually make a report or review visible at an earlier stage/status.

## Always Show Bid/Engagement Panels to LOs:
Statement: If disabled, LOs do not have the ability to see the Bid/Engagement panel at any time. If enabled, the panel becomes visible on the Request Wizard and within a Request. During Request creation, this panel would allow LOs to enter their desired valuation scenarios as well as any other information that can assist with the bid/engagement process.
Question(s): Would you like to make the panel visible to LOs?
Additional Information: We can hide/remove fields from the Bid/Engagement panel and only display the fields you want the Lender to populate/view.

## Always Show Bank Documents Subpanels to LOs:
Statement: Bank Documents are documents are used for things like Review Forms, Checklists, etc. By default, LOs cannot see the panel that displays these docs.
Question(s): Would you like your LOs to have visibility to this panel?
Additional Information: Docs can be made visible/hidden individually from LOs if applicable, so we can make the panel visible but still hide specific documents from the panel if needed. An example would be if you want the Lender to create the Borrower Invoice instead of the Job Manager.

## Enable Loan Officer Bid Selection:
Statement: LO Bid Selection allows a JM to send 1 or all of the submitted bids that have been received from vendors and send them to the LO for a time/fee approval/selection.
Question(s): Would you like to enable this functionality?
Recommendation: Enable; it is an optional step in the workflow.

Automatically Check “Display to LOs”
Statement: Before a JM can use the LO Bid Selection button, they have to select which bids they’d like to present to the LO by checking the box next to that specific bid.
Question(s): Would you like all vendor bids to have the “Display to LO” checkbox checked or unchecked by default?
Additional Information: Not applicable if “Enable LO Bid Selection” is disabled.

## Default the Loan Officer to the Ordered By:
Statement: When creating a new Request, the logged in user placing the order is automatically populated in the Ordered By field.
Question(s): Would you like the LO field to auto-populate with the Ordered By user? Or would you like this field to always be blank and need to be selected manually?
Recommendation: Do not auto-populate, otherwise user may forget to change it




Require Prepayment Proof
Statement: If enabled, this feature will require the LO to upload prepayment proof at the time of Bid Selection/approval (if LO Bid Selection is enabled).
Question(s): Would you like to enable this feature?
Additional Information: If “Enable LO Bid Selection” is disabled or all LOs use Glances, this does not apply/can be skipped

## Add JM Notification Copy or LO Notification Copy to the List View with “My Items” Checked:
Statement: If you selected to have either the JM or LO Notification Copy fields visible on the Request form, this setting controls those users’ ability to see requests that their name is on, when “My Items” is checked on the Requests tab.
Question(s): Would you like users in the JM or LO Notification Copy fields to see those requests on their main Requests page when the “My Items” checkbox is checked?
Recommendation: The recommendation is to enable this function, so the user is able to see all orders they are involved in, even if they are not the primary Job Manager or lender on the order.

## Allow Loan Officers to act as Job Managers for Selected Request Types:
Statement: By default, only JMs and Bank Admins can be listed as a Job Manager within a request.
Question(s): Would you like to allow specific LOs to be able to be listed as a Job Manager on specified requests, allowing them to facilitate bidding and engaging vendors.

## Allow Loan Officers to Clone:
Statement: By default a Job Manager or Bank Admin can clone an existing request to reduce time spent inputting data for new requests. Cloned requests only retain the data that is generally entered when the lender is submitting a new request.
Question(s): Would you like to also allow LOs to do this?




## ‘i’ (Additional Details) on the Request List View:

## Show Request Documents on Vendor Bid Solicitation Webform:
Statement: When sending out bid requests, each solicited vendor will be sent a webform to interact with your bid request. This setting controls if they can view the Request Documents section at this stage. The vendor will only be presented with the documents that the Job Manager has checked to be visible at solicitation.
Question(s): Do you need vendors to have access to any Request Documents at the time of bidding?
Recommendation: Enable
Additional Information: Without this setting enabled, even if a Request Document is set to “Display to Vendor – Solicitation”, it will not appear on their webform.

## Request Documents – Default “Display to Vendor – Solicitation” Checkbox:
Statement: In the Request Documents panel, there is a column to select a checkbox of whether or not a document should be displayed to a vendor during solicitation.
Question(s): Would you like this checkbox to automatically default to ‘display’ for all uploaded request documents?
Recommendation: Disable
Additional Information: If enabled, a Job Manager would have to uncheck any documents they do not want to be presented to the vendor at solicitation.

## Request Documents – Default “Display to Vendor - Engagement” Checkbox:
Statement: In the Request Documents panel, there is a column to select a checkbox of whether or not a document should be displayed to a vendor after engagement.
