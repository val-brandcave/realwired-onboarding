Request Record – Job Manager  view



Request In fo  P anel


 Below you will find screenshots of the Request Record panels with the default fields.  Most of  the fields are simply text fields, some are dropdown value fields and  F ield  T emplates.  


Please advise if any field names need to be relabeled, removed or if a field needs to be added to further describe the request/order that is being placed for the specific property. The fields you see with  a  red  *  indicate  that field is a required field and will need to be completed prior to moving on to the next page. Please advise if any additional fields need to be set as a required field and/or if  any  current required field do es  not need this requirement.

Intended Use  of Request :  In addition to this field allowing for “free type” this is what we call a  Field  Template   and you  are able to  create multiple templates (you provide the wording and template  name  and we will enter on the back end of YouConnect). This will help to cut down on data entry and works well when  repeated information needs to be populated for each property. The template choices you see below  in our default are just examples and can be used or removed  (FYI your bank name would be entered  in the template below where it says Bank Name):

Special Note*

Date Needed  –  This  is the date the Loan Officer is asking to have the report returned to them .  One option i s  to relabel this to  Dated Needed (Report & Review)   if you   want to make it   clear to your   lenders  this would be the date for both the Report and Review to be completed. 

* Prior Appraisal Date and Prior Appraised Value  –   The L oan  O fficer ’s do not fill these  fields , however  if there was a previous  appraisal done  on a property ,  the next time a new order is submitted against th e  property th e  Prior Appraised Value & Date  will automatically populate.  We recommend you do not remove this from the Request Record.   

Billing / Branch Code (Also know n  as Cost Center)  & GL Acct  fields  are connected to  a Loan Officer’s user profile.  When a Loan Officer is selected on a Request , the Billing/Branch Code & GL Acct # will automatically populate  (only if the user record has these fields populated – when  we ingest your users into YouConnect you will be given the opportunity to provide  this information or we can explain to the Loan officers during their training they will need to update their profile to add in this information ) .

Lending Group –  if you use Lending Group s  for Accounting purposes please provide us with your list and we will add them  as selectable  values.  This will also be an availa ble  option to include on your user  list  and we will  discuss  further when we get to that section. 

HPML –  this is an old  function  and it is not normally used.  We will remove unless you say otherwise.
