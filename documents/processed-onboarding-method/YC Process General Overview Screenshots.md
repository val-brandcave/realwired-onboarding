- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/YC Process General Overview Screenshots.pdf
- **Purpose**: Provide prospective/new clients with a visual overview of YouConnect processes and interfaces before or after the welcome call.

## Summary
This artifact offers high‑level screenshots illustrating key areas of the platform and core workflows discussed during sales and onboarding kickoff. It helps set expectations for the phased approach, the role of Job Managers and Loan Officers, and how configuration choices (request types, routing, timers) manifest in the UI.

## Recommended Usage

- Use as a visual reference in the welcome/kickoff call to anchor terminology and next steps.
