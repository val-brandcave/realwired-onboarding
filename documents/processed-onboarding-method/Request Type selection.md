# Request Type Selection (1-Step vs 2-Step)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Request Type selection.docx
- **Purpose**: Define initial Request/Order Types and whether each follows a 1-step (Review only) or 2-step (Vendor + Review) workflow.

## Summary
Clients provide the list of Request Types used by Appraisal and, where applicable, Environmental departments. For each Request Type, select a workflow:
- **2-Step**: Vendor solicitation/engagement to produce a report; then internal or external review. Option to mark “No Review Needed.”
- **1-Step**: No vendor; review-only workflow (second half of 2-step).

## Examples
- 2-Step: Commercial Appraisal; Residential Appraisal; Commercial/Residential Evaluation (external vendor); External Inspection; Environmental Phase I.
- 1-Step: Review of a 3rd Party Report; Review Only; In‑House Order.

## Client Actions
- Submit Request Types and designate 1-step or 2-step for each.
- Indicate any types where review can be optional.
