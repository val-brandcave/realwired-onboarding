# Reject Reasons (Defaults and Review)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Reject Reasons.docx
- **Audience**: Job Managers
- **Purpose**: Provide standardized reasons to reject and return requests to Loan Officers for correction.

## Summary
Upon request assignment, Job Managers review the Property/Request records and supporting documents. If information is missing or incorrect, they can reject the request, selecting a reason from a default list and returning it to the LO. The document provides a default set of reject reasons for client review.

## Client Actions
- Review the default list of reject reasons.
- Propose edits (additions/removals/renames) to align with internal terminology and process.
