# Property Record (Defaults and Configuration)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Property Record.docx
- **Purpose**: Describe default Property Record fields, requireds, dropdowns, and Reg B configuration options.

## Summary
The Property Record captures core property details. Clients may relabel, add, remove, or mark fields as required. Dropdowns (e.g., Units of Measure, Ownership Type, Property Status) and Field Templates (e.g., Multiple Building Description) can be tailored. Reg B notifications can be enabled with two Yes/No fields and notification triggers.

## Client Decisions
- Field changes: relabel, add/remove, required flags.
- Confirm dropdown values for Units of Measure, Ownership Type, Property Status.
- Provide Field Template content (name + text) for repeated narratives (e.g., Multiple Building Description).
- Decide on Reg B enablement and triggers (on Initial Submit, Completion, etc.); provide notification email(s). Optionally send to Reg B Admin and select stage.
- Scope: Reg B can be limited by Request Type (e.g., Residential only).

## Notes
- Category/Type values come from the completed workbook.
- Bank field autoâ€‘populates the bank name.
