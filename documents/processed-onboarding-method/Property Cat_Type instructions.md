# Property Category / Property Type Instructions

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Property Cat_Type instructions.docx
- **Purpose**: Explain how Property Category and Property Type (aka Type/Sub‑Type) are used and collect client selections via workbook.

## Summary
When creating a Request/Order, users select a Property Category (Type) which filters the available Property Types (Sub‑Types). These fields strictly describe the property at time of order; other attributes (owner‑occupied, inspection needed) are captured elsewhere. A workbook is provided with default Category/Type options for client review and edits.

## Client Actions
- Complete the attached Category/Type workbook: add, edit, or remove values.
- Return the workbook for configuration before testing.

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure Category/Type dropdowns are populated from the finalized workbook.
- Keep non‑categorical attributes out of these fields to avoid conflation.
