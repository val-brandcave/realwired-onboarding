# Document Type Names (Defaults and Review)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Document Type names.docx
- **Audience**: Bank Loan Officers and administrators
- **Purpose**: Standardize document uploads by selecting a Document Type at upload time; gather client-specific changes to defaults.

## Summary
The document explains that when a Loan Officer creates a request and uploads supporting files, they must select a "Document Type" to categorize the file. It presents a default list of types and asks the client to review, proposing additions, removals, or renames as needed.

## Implementation Guidance
- Require a Document Type selection on upload for consistency and downstream filtering.
- Provide the default list in-app; include tooltips/examples where ambiguous.
- Capture client-requested changes as part of onboarding; update the dropdown list accordingly.

## Client Actions
- Review the default list of Document Types.
- Provide requested changes (add, remove, rename) prior to testing.
