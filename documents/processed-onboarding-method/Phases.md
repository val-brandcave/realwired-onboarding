- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Phases.docx
- **Purpose**: Outline of the YouConnect onboarding lifecycle, timelines, responsibilities, and key milestones.

## Summary
The onboarding process is structured into sequential phases from welcome and kickoff through site configuration, user/vendor setup, training, and UAT. Success depends on early IT whitelisting, timely client decisions during configuration, and coordination for imports and trainings.

## Phases
- **Phase 1: Welcome + Kickoff**
  - Schedule welcome/getting-started call post-contract with Client Success Director and bank POC(s).
  - Send email requesting bank logo and URL approval; IT to whitelist `@bankname.realwired.com` and `no-reply@bankname.realwired.com` and allow the chosen URL.
  - Coordinate a 45-minute kickoff with key decision makers to confirm timeline (Go‑Live), cadence, expectations.

- **Phase 2: Customize YouConnect Site (3–4 weeks)**
  - Mix of calls and guided documents to collect configuration decisions.
  - Client coordinates internal stakeholders to answer configuration questions.

- **Phase 3: User Setup**
  - Determine roles/permissions; provide User Import Workbook.
  - Client completes workbook; RealWired performs the import.

- **Phase 4: Appraisal Dept (Job Manager) Training + UAT**
  - RealWired delivers Job Manager training.
  - Bank admins/appraisal team conduct UAT upon initial configuration completion.

- **Phase 5: Vendor Management**
  - Vendor setup with client; provide Vendor Import Workbook; RealWired imports vendors.
  - Decide on Vendor Credential Monitoring (adds ~2–3 weeks if implemented).

- **Phase 6: User Training**
  - RealWired hosts two lender training sessions; bank coordinates and invites attendees.
  - Bank records at least one session for lender reference.

## Dependencies & Notes
- IT whitelisting and URL access must be completed early to avoid delays.
- Imports (users/vendors) are executed by RealWired based on client‑completed workbooks.
- Credential monitoring decision impacts overall timeline.
