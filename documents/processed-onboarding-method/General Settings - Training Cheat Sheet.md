# General Settings – Training Cheat Sheet (v 08-18-25)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/General Settings - Training Cheat Sheet v 08 18 25.docx
- **Purpose**: Internal/external guide to drive the General Settings configuration call; includes client-facing wording, options, and internal tips (incl. Glances specifics).

## Summary
This comprehensive guide prepares CSMs for the General Settings session and captures client choices. It covers pre‑call prep (client context, fees), Glances nuances, demo/test file setup, call tips, and a detailed table of settings with:
- Client‑friendly descriptions and option sets (A, B, …)
- Internal notes/tips and gotchas
- Placeholders to record client decisions
- Glossary and screenshots for select settings

## Notable Prep Items
- Confirm URL, key contacts, current system, request types, environmental/external review usage, naming for LO/JM fields, and fee structure.
- Pre‑set a few defaults to demo on client site (e.g., hide VBR recommend, remove JM copy on cloning, require Review Due Date).
- Create optional test files to illustrate fees, VBR, and review approval flows.

## Representative Settings Covered
- Default request status filters; My Items defaults per role
- Report format requirement; preliminary drafts; business vs calendar days
- Dropdown ordering (editor order); parcel number format
- Login‑as policy; edit on hold; review approval feature; review due date required
- Estimated total completion notifications; request/vendor/reviewer reminders
- Accounting/billing fields and visibility; batch processing notifications
- Bid/Engagement panel selection and related dropdowns/templates

## Guidance
- Emphasize that choices can be adjusted during testing or post‑go‑live.
- For Glances‑only LOs, still configure YC so future direct logins are viable.
- Use the table as a living document—copy and refine per client; keep notes updated.
