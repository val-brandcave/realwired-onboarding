# Vendor Grade – Weighted Average (Sample Rubric)

- **Source**: documents/current-onboarding-method/Samples of Vendor Grade Weighted Average.docx
- **Purpose**: Example scoring rubric and weights for post‑assignment vendor evaluations in Vendor Management.

## Weights (Commercial Appraisal)
- **Appraisal Quality/Methodology**: 40%
- **Timing**: 25%
- **Corrections**: 20%
- **Professionalism**: 15%

Each category is scored 1–5 with guidance statements describing performance bands (from rejected/late/unprofessional to exceeds expectations/early/highly professional).

## Implementation Notes
- Configure rubric categories and weights per client policy; expose scoring UI to JMs post‑completion.
- Calculate weighted average to drive vendor performance reporting and bid panel insights.
- Maintain an audit trail of scores and allow periodic recalibration of weights/definitions.
