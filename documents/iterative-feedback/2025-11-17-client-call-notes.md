**Date**: 2025-11-17  
**Context**: YouConnect Onboarding Flow (Client and CS Portal)

---

### Agenda

- **Showcase**: Updated vibe-coded prototype of the YouConnect Onboarding Flow (Client and CS Portal).
- ~~Quick preview of the Figma project~~.

---

### Auth Screens

- **Add separate auth flows**:
  - For **Customer Success** users.
  - For **Customer** users.

---

### Review Screens

- **Add a review screen before completion** for every module:
  - Appears before the user reaches the **“Complete”** screen.
  - Allows the user to review all of their information.

---

### Success Screen

- **Clarify editability**:
  - Explicitly communicate that users can always come back and change the form.

---

### Onboarding Participants

- **Simplify inviting participants**:
  - Instead of manually typing participant emails:
    - Allow adding users directly in the UI.
    - Generate an **authenticated link** that can be shared.
    - Recipients can **accept the invite** and **set up their password**, etc.

---

### Customer Hub

- **Module visibility**:
  - Do **not hide modules** when a user is not assigned.
  - Instead, **show the module** but **prevent the user from starting it** unless they are assigned.

- **Completed modules**:
  - Add a **“Review”** tertiary action next to **“Edit”**.
  - **“Review”** takes the user to the module’s review page.

- **Customer success team visibility**:
  - Show the **Customer Success team** to the user.
  - Ensure this can be **edited**.

---

### Property Fields

- **Redesign the interface**:
  - Make it more like a **Gravity Forms**-style form builder.
  - Coordinate with **Cody** if a video reference is needed.

---

### CS Hub / Client Details

- **Client details sidebar**:
  - In the main sidebar on client details, show a **donut pie chart** for **percent completeness**.
  - Apply this approach wherever percent completeness is relevant in the CS Hub.
