[@0:01](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1.08) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

All right, so Ed is not going to be able to make it, so you're stuck with just me, but I'm going to walk you through and show you the exercise, and then I have a document that I think will help.

[@0:12](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=12.2) \- **Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, sounds good. Let's wait another minute. I think Cody would be joining us in a minute. Okay.

[@0:19](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=19.58) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

No problem. I'm going to show my... Hey, Cody. Hey, team. Hi. Hey. All right. I told Val already that Ed isn't going to make it on here, so you guys are stuck with me, but I will be the one walking you through, kind of, I'll you the overlay of the problem we're trying to solve, right?

And then I have some documentation that'll help out with the first section we want to accomplish. Amazing.

[@1:21](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=81.932) \- **Cody Miles**

All right. Sunda, as we're doing this, I know you're going to kind of walk me through how it's currently done, but it'd be really helpful to hear how you think it would be improved by the software and what, and some of the things I'm trying to solve for is, like, how can I make one user input represent, you know, two different outputs, right?

Like, if there's two settings, like, how can one user setting, you know, do more than one thing, right? Yeah.

So, okay. That's my challenge to figure out, but any help you can get there, I think would be great.

All right.

[@1:51](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=111.112) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

So, this being the system, what happens when somebody is going to onboard is, we have different modules and different things that we have to do in admin to walk them through the process, right?

Right. So one of the first things we ask them about, and this won't be one of the first assignments because it's not that difficult, is what order types they want to have, right?

And whether they're one step or two step, and we can figure that. That process is not real super labor intensive as far as the configurations we do on our side.

But getting the client to understand what order types do you want to have and the difference behind it might be something we do want to tackle as we move forward.

So that's one of the first things we talk about in order to get the order types they have. And when I say one step or two step, it just means that think of our order, and it's broken up into two factors, right?

One is it's going to go out to a vendor for a report. It's going to come back, and then it might go out to another vendor for review or internally for review, or they might decide they don't need to review it, right?

That's two step. A one step process is it's a review only. They already have a report, and they're reviewing a report.

Or somebody, they got a report from another bank and they're reviewing it to see if they'll accept it. It might be an evaluation they do internally, so it's only a one-step.

So there's a one-step, two-step report approach. And that is something that we kind of walk through and explain to clients and things like that.

And then they give it back to us and then it's through communication. So automating that is not as big of a deal at the very beginning right now, right?

Cool.

[@3:25](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=205.136) \- **Cody Miles**

So just to make sure I understand, do you have to go into the software every time you onboard a new customer and you build out the order type and you basically say, like, it's going to go to this person and then this person or whatever?

We have to build out everything every time we go into the software.

[@3:39](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=219.256) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Okay, got it. And every bank is unique and every bank is going to be configured differently. There's some things that we anticipate.

You know, there'll be a progression of being able to do it. But this is a two-prong approach, guys. So one is our top priority is not to have to have the CS members understand so much or know so.

The second hope is that we make it so good that we'll be able to give a lot of these areas to the client where they just answer the questions and then either we can figure on the back end or it automatically configures it for us, which is the end goal, right?

That, hey, a client is able to fill this stuff out and based on what they're presented with, they make their selections and it goes and configures it for them.

So phase one would be, hey, CS puts these things in and we can figure for them or we at least have it to where the client answers these questions, it comes back to us and then a configurer can add it in until we get the backing of the developers to make those settings for us based on the choices, right?

Once they do that and it works for CS, then it's something we can look at giving the client to do and it automatically configures those sections, right?

But there are a lot of sections, guys. A lot, right? So what I want to do is kind of explain in onboarding, we get the...

Quest types and stuff. We understand, and it's kind of like a consultative onboarding to help them because some are switching from other systems and things.

And so we get the general set up done. And then as they test, there may be changes we make to the setup based on what they're finding because you don't know what you don't know when you're entering a new system, right?

So after we do that, we go through a process where we show them the screens. We have a property screen.

It's the same screen for all properties that they're going to have. Now, every bank may have different requirements for what they want on a property record.

So what I mean by that is, is that we give the options of, okay, here's our standard template fields that we have on onboarding, right?

We always clone from a template site. And then we go through and they may not want to call it address.

They may want to call it street address. So we can change labels. We can create new fields and new types.

So fields, this is not something I'm anticipating to solve. I'm just letting you guys know what the process is.

We decide if they want it to be required or not required. We remove fields they don't want. We add fields they do.

And then we have a solid property record that the client uses. Okay. There might be field template fields that we put in the back end that has different kind of text that auto inserts and things.

I'm not trying to get all of that solved for right now. Eventually, that would be great for a client experience so they can say, oh, I want this field gone, this field added.

But, you know, we're not there yet, you know. So, again, we're trying to solve for the CS issue first.

So we have those things. And when we do an onboarding, we have an hour and a half call every week, sometimes more than that, with these clients on the phone in order to go through these things.

So if we can make it easier for CS, meaning they don't have to be on the phone going through this because we give it to the client and they fill this out, even if we have to go configure it afterwards for now, it still saves us a lot of time.

We're not on the phone with the client explaining it, right? It's already got explanations. And they're filling it out.

Totally.

[@7:02](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=422.684) \- **Cody Miles**

How many of those onboarding calls does it usually take? You said 1.5 hours every week.

[@7:08](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=428.224) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Usually to get through all of the configurations, it's four to five calls. Okay. All right. It depends on the complexity of the client, right?

And how many changes and things like that. So that's one thing. Then we build out what we call the default order form.

The default order form is like soup to nuts, everything the client would want on an order form. And then sometimes we veer from that and make different layouts and things.

So as you go through the process, and I'm just trying to give you, this automatically comes up. It's a Google map.

And then if they had an integration, this comes up. I'm not worried about any of that stuff. But then we have another form that we go through with the client.

And we'll say, okay, what we want to do is have everything that you need on the order form. And then we can take it.

And if we have to morph it for your residential versus your commercial, They can do so, and we have a way to do different layouts on the back end.

So again, what fields do you want? What don't you want? What do we want to rename? What can we do?

A lot of times there's a lot of consultation here. So I'm not expecting this to be done outside at any time soon.

This would be a very complex matter, and it would have to have almost conversation back and forth in order to assist the client in their decision-making.

But I wanted you to understand what this part of it is, right? And then we have a secondary part of this form, which is after bid engagement.

It then goes down to the review section, and so we show them that form. So that's one of the first things we do.

And then we do what we call, we start going into admin and the settings for things, all right? So this is where one of the first phases I think we can really benefit the CS side of things by doing that.

So once the forms are configured, we then go into general settings and then users and workflow timers and vendors, and you're about to see.

Okay. Let's Our admin section looks like this right now. I'm seeing order form right now. Right, right. It's coming.

Yeah.

[@9:12](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=552.768) \- **Cody Miles**

While that's done, can repeat the steps as I heard them? Yeah. So first is creating and configuring the request types.

The second is creating, configuring the fields, changing labels, required fields, hide fields, create new fields, et cetera. Third is configuring the order form.

So the first one is property form and the second part is the order form.

[@9:35](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=575.068) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Oh, okay. So, okay.

[@9:37](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=577.668) \- **Cody Miles**

Property form. forms. One is the property form and then we do the order form.

[@9:42](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=582.128) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

And then we wait before, because after we do the order form, we do is you have job managers in a bank and then you have the lenders, right?

The lenders put in the orders. They need a redacted view of the form, meaning they don't get to see everything on the form.

So what happens after we get through the exercise of building out the form? We go through the rest of the settings and they start testing.

At that point, we then take that form that they created that has everything on it, soup to nuts, and we then remove everything we don't want.

We make a team and call it the LO view, so the lender view. So it them off all the things that the job managers and the bank would never want the lenders to have privy to, like conversations with the vendor, all kinds of things like that.

So that happens later in the process. And then that's when we also determine if we need to make specialty layouts for any reason, where this form for ordering environmental looks different than your appraisal ordering form.

And we have to have to have a unique layout for that. So, like I said, that's very intensive and it's consultative at this point, right?

Yeah, yeah. In the admin section, anything you see with these Google, like glasses, I don't know what you want to call them, 00s, glasses, that is available for a bank administrator.

Meaning a bank administrator has ability to do some of these duties, like drop downs, right? They can edit their drop down.

values and lists and stuff. Not very easy right now to show them, but it's kind of clunky. So there's all kinds of things we could work on on the interface in here.

I have a ton guys for you when it comes to that stuff. But one of the first things we go to do, and when I think our first section, because if I tried to give you all of it, it would be a mess, right?

As you can see, there are a lot of configurations, settings, and places we go in here. And each does something different and whatnot.

So lots of improvement we could do for the clients, but also lots of improvement we could do for CS to make things easier as well.

So one of the things that we do is we go in and we determine routing is another step that we take.

And we determine routing based on, you have three ways to route orders in our system. One way is you make a request type job manager.

And all that really means is that... So for all commercial appraisals, when the order comes in from lending into the job manager in the system here, it automatically gets assigned to a specific person and it stops there.

So it automatically goes to Sunda. And if Sunda doesn't pick it up in a certain amount of time, it goes to Brenda, right?

Our clients can see these things and they can adjust some of the things in this form and some they cannot for a lot of different reasons, right?

So that's kind of a hybrid, not again, I'm going to give you guys general settings first, but this is one of the things that we do.

The second way of routing is. I just want to make sure I understand it though.

[@12:37](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=757.184) \- **Cody Miles**

I have already configured my, my request types. And so here I'm just configuring like where they get routed to when the request type happens.

Yes, exactly. So it could be here.

[@12:48](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=768.944) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

So if you have a request type job manager, the buck stops there. Now we also have what you call a signed area.

So some banks say, I have a generic box appraisals at ABC bank. And I, I, I want that to come in and then one of my job managers is going to get on it and assign it to who they want to assign it to and they'll own that request from that moment forward.

But I want it to come into a general box. Some banks use assigned area to pick different locations they may have.

And you pick that location and it gets routed based on the location. That's what we call assigned area routing.

So it's an option. So the trunk is request type. And then we have logical routing and then assigned area routing.

So assigned area routing just says based on a selection or a default on the property record, it's going to automatically get assigned to whatever person.

So as an example, in this setup here, I have on this site. If I go into assigned area, it first looks, is there a request type job manager?

If not, I'm going to go to the assigned area. Oh, if it's West Coast on the property record or somebody picks West Coast for the assigned area, it's going to go to Nashit.

If they pick Eastern Oklahoma, it's going to go to Brenda. And then it could escalate. that's a side.

[@14:03](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=843.188) \- **Cody Miles**

Sorry, is this part of routing though? So it actually changes the routing.

[@14:07](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=847.608) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Okay. It is. Yes. So again, the first thing that happens when a request is submitted, the database goes, hey, is there a request type job manager?

Yes or no? Yes. Assign it. Done. Oh, no, there's no request type job manager. Now I'm going to look to logical routing.

If there is no logical routing schema, then I'm going to fall back to assigned routing. Okay. So the assigned routing, this one is the bottom tier of the list.

And it just says whatever is chosen and it could be a default. They might just have appraisal department and appraisal department email here.

And so everything that comes in goes to that one generic. Right. And that's it. There's no other kind of routing set up or they might have this set up, but for specific request types, they have it automatically routing to somebody.

That's why the system automatically goes, is it going to, is there anything on the request type for routing? If so, follow that.

The end. If not, go to logical. So, that. Here's logical routing. And I showed you a sign because it's kind of an easy basis.

It could be one place or it could be driven by a lender choosing a selection in the field when they create the property record.

Real quick, before you move on, this is not where I created the assigned area.

[@15:18](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=918.14) \- **Cody Miles**

So I didn't see any crud around assigned area setup.

[@15:22](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=922.5) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

I'll show you that one second. I wanted to back to the logical since I went. I always forget about logical.

Okay. So first you have the request type. It's set there. This is logical routing. If I wanted to create a logical routing, what I do, and they can create as many rules as they want.

We have some people with 90 rules. You hit click create logical routing. Now your logical routing looks at different fields on the order.

So it says, who do you want to assign it to? And who do you want to copy? If you're assigning it to somebody and you want to assign copy, you can do both.

Okay. So you're going to pick your person, the user in the bank that you wanted to sign to. And then you're going to say, if it's a request type, it's a commercial appraisal.

to it's appraisal. appraisal, add Yeah. All It could be multiple things. It could be a commercial appraisal or a residential appraisal.

And it's in Florida, right? The lending group is called Florida or the lending group is called Senior Administration and they get to name their lending group.

So it's whatever their lending groups are, show here because we've configured the lending groups already, right? And the location is in Hawaii.

So if a client says they want logical routing, usually do that towards the end. If they just want to sign the area routing or request type routing, we'll set it up towards the beginning.

So it just depends on their choices because we have to get all these things in here. So if the location is Hawaii or North Dakota and they have a property category of all of these, I want you in a region is all of these or a loan amount can be here or here, or you don't have to have some criteria.

It's just going to be based on that criteria. It'll automatically assign it to that person when it comes in.

[@16:54](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1014.57) \- **Cody Miles**

So this is for like, is this mostly used for like edge cases of like, well, when this kind of criteria is met, we got to send it to this.

This job manager?

[@17:02](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1022.32) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Okay. Yep, exactly. Exactly.

[@17:04](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1024.66) \- **Cody Miles**

The only thing we're doing in routing in general, though, is just assigning to a job manager. We're not assigning to different types of users.

I saw there was an escalation job manager, but it's really just job manager and escalation job manager.

[@17:15](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1035.42) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Correct. Correct. Because if one person's out, they don't want it slipping through the cracks. So if they don't answer it, they accept the assignment in 24 hours or reassign it, it goes to somebody else.

So the order doesn't sit there, right? They want to keep it moving. So request type setup, yay or nay.

If nay, for that specific order, look to logical routing. Is there a rule in logical routing for this? Yay or nay?

If not, go to assigned area. That's it. Okay. So, and again, the assigned area would just be usually on a default or whatever.

So it just depends. Some banks have all request type. Every one of them is request type. They don't use any logical or assign.

Some have just assigned area. They use nothing else. Some have assigned area, logical routing, and request type setup. But everybody knows request type setup trumps everything.

If it stops, the buck stops there if somebody has it there. Okay. think Bye. Bye. Bye. So that's the routing configuration.

Now, after we get the other stuff set up because we want to be able to get them testing as soon as possible, right?

With just the general form that we originally set up with our order form and our property, we got to go through what we call general settings.

And that's the crux of our conversation today is going to be in this general settings. All right. So when you go through general settings, there's some things we mentioned, some things we don't, dependent, you know, on the timing of it.

So all of these are settings that drive the whole system. The clients cannot get to this without us. We set these general settings ourselves, okay?

So at first, it's, hey, can we get an interface that lets the client or CS answer these questions so that one of us can figures and know how to do it, just get that instead of having to sit on the call and go through the whole thing with the client, right?

Every time. don't give it to clients because this is complex or because they could get themselves into a really bad state.

Right now, it's because a client can't do this because they have no idea what any of this stuff means.

the CS team doesn't know what it means. So that's why one of our advanced techs have to get online and walk through the client to give best practices and how it works, okay?

In order to say whether we check the button or not check the button, okay? So there's a lot of things in here, and some of them can be set now.

Some of them we have to set later or change later, but it gives a general consensus. So something like the VBR, hide the recommend button, we do that on all sites.

It's an old function that we have. So any new client, it's automatically defaulted to on. So we don't even bring that up to them, and CS doesn't need to worry about that setting, right?

So that's just one that we have in there because we have one client that just has to have that button still.

Once they get rid of it, then we'll be able to get rid of that setting. So I'm not worried about that.

Disabled report format required. So one of the native required fields to our system is report format, and the reason why

That is, is that when somebody is filling out, so let's say you've been given an order as a job manager and you all of a sudden, you know, you have the vendor solicitation button as soon as you accept it.

Well, you forgot to fill out your bid panel to tell the vendor what you need them to bid on to do the job.

So report format is something that drives that as a reminder. So if somebody forgot to put in the report format and they hit vendor solicitation, it'll pop you and say, pick your report format.

That makes you, oh, crap, I need to fill that section out so they can pick the report format. Then they hit edit, fill their bid section out, and then send it out to vendors.

Some banks say, I don't want that. I don't need that reminder. My guys are always going to put in their stuff.

They know they have to put it in, so we don't need that to be dependent on it. Some may not want to use that field, okay?

So that's why we have the ability to override the requirement for them to have the report format because it was a programmatically required field, not one we just go set with our ability to set things in the system.

So we can set required fields, but not for everything. Thank you. Thank Thank There's that. Systematic fields. this was one of them.

Okay. So we usually don't check that unless somebody tells us they're not using it. So that's kind of a mundane thing.

Remove the job manager notification copy when cloning a request. So on our orders, you have a primary job manager.

And then you can have up to two job manager copies, meaning I'm the job manager, but I want these other two job managers to work with me and they're going to get all the notices I get about this order as it processes.

So this just says when you clone an order, so you can, you can create an order one or two ways, create a new order from scratch.

Or if you already had an order last year, and now you need to order the same thing again this year, you can clone it and then make your edits and then submit it.

So this just says, Hey, when you clone, don't have these extra job managers on here. They may not need to be involved this time.

So that's what that setting does. Right. If somebody is using our send to accounting feature at that point in time, we send an email out every time.

Order gets closed out. We send an email out to a specific accounting email address that's configured elsewhere and it goes out and lets them know that the job was done and here's the invoice and here's the amounts and here's all the stuff you need to know in order to pay your vendors and close out the order.

Now, we have some clients that use what we call batch processing and instead of it going every single time an order closes, what happens is it just sets a date and then the job manager, whoever does the batch processing runs a report and then uploads that report that they've sent it over to batch processing.

So they don't want the individual emails to go out anymore. That's all this means is that, hey, yes, we have the process running, we're using it, but no, don't send the emails out as each job closes because we're going to batch that together.

Okay. So that's what that means. And again, these are not things we would go over right at the beginning because we don't even go over the send to accounting right at the very beginning.

So you see the challenge in terms some of these options, it's different times that you would select them because you don't

don't know what you don't know at the beginning. Right, right.

[@23:03](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1383.72) \- **Cody Miles**

So it'd be great to have more user-based or user story-based questions than outputs in some of these configurations.

[@23:11](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1391.62) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Exactly. Exactly. And so batch processing, this is where we decide to turn it on. When they are introduced to a standard accounting feature, which is generally right before they start testing at the very end, yes, we want to do that.

Oh, okay, we don't know. Let me see if I want to use batch processing or not. So this would turn on the batch processing itself.

And this is the people, can have up to three people that'll get the notification for batch processing. That's all that is.

So sometimes this never gets configured at a bank because they just want the normal accounting or they don't use the accounting function at all.

Okay. So that's one of the ways that we ask questions later on after we get the general settings configured.

But I didn't want you guys going in here going, well, what's all this stuff then? Don't they ask it at the beginning?

Well, no, there's reasons we don't ask always at the beginning because they don't know enough to know how to answer it yet.

Right. It wouldn't make sense. Thank you. I Um, this is just the request statuses. And what I mean by that is when somebody first logs onto the system and goes in, it always presents after their first initial login.

They go to the request page and it has a default of submitted in progress and usually not submitted. These are the three things highlighted with their items checked.

So they're seeing their workload as a job manager or a lender, depending on the rules that we've set, you can uncheck and see all items going.

Uh, but at first it just filters it down to any item you're, you're, you know, is that you're the job manager on.

Um, this, some people like that not submitted showing, but that just means that it's a order that could be coming down the pipe, but may not.

They might cancel it before they ever submit it. So some, some job managers like to see those that are potential for coming in and some don't.

So this, it gives us the ability to say, do we want to show that for loan officer or job manager?

Yeah.

[@24:55](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1495.17) \- **Cody Miles**

I'm sorry, you're setting the default filter for all users. Jane, all job managers or.

[@25:00](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1500.8) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

all loan officers. So do you want all your loan officers? So do I want to hide it or not, right?

Do I want to show it or not? So if I wanted to show not submitted, I just check this, hit save, and now not submitted will automatically be visible to all job managers.

And then I would set it for the loan officers or what I want them to see. Totally.

[@25:18](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1518.64) \- **Cody Miles**

But that's just setting the default for the filters. They can still change the filters once they...

[@25:22](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1522.64) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Yes, absolutely. Yes, that's just the default. Absolutely.

[@25:25](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1525.36) \- **Cody Miles**

And then can they change their own default settings?

[@25:29](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1529.0) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

No, they cannot. Okay. Nope, nope. This is not per user. This is one of things that is not per user.

All of these in here are just set and it's system-wide. Yeah, wide. Yeah, got it. Yep. All right. Parcel number.

We have a parcel number field and it could be where the parcel number is just a city and just a number field.

Or you can turn on where you have to have the city, state, or city, county, and number, right? And what I mean by that is, right here here.

We have the ability for them to add a tax ID, parcel number, however you want to call it for the property, right?

And this is a parcel number. If I hit add, I can put in a number or whatever it is, right?

They have another one. If I check that box and save, it adds two more fields here that they have to pick a state.

And then it just changes it where they're picking the state and the county for that and then adding the number.

So it adds two more dropdowns here that wouldn't normally be here unless they want that to be available, right?

Not all banks want all of that there. So that's what that does. Request type order in Wizard, use the dropdown editor order.

What that means is that we have a dropdown editor and all of our request types are in the dropdown editor, right?

It automatically creates them in this dropdown editor. Now, the client cannot get to that and edit that even in their dropdown, but we can.

So what we say is whatever order I put it in, in the dropdown, make that order share. Use that order.

What's the default? Usually we check that because we wanted to always do that. So if we go change the order or something, then the default order is like alphabetical or whichever way you entered it in.

So you can have it whatever. So if I enter a request that starts with a D and then one that starts with a P and then one that starts with a Z, then one that starts with a A, it's going to be in that order.

It's whatever order I put it in when I entered it. Then you can go to the editor and move it around.

And if you have this checked, it'll move with it. So we usually check that. So we don't have to have that as a, as a problem.

And again, that affects not the clients, but just our side of things. So there's not a whole lot of these things with stuff.

Enable preliminary drafts. Some banks use preliminary drafts, some don't. And that just enables a vendor or somebody that's working on a report to enter a draft in.

So. So. So. The bank can see that before it forces them to upload the report. So they have an early ability to check and review what a vendor is working on.

And that's really a client preference thing. And sometimes we find that out now, but sometimes we don't find that out until testing.

So we go back and set it. So as you can see with CS, it would be a lot easier to find these things if they were in a different order for sure.

Or heuristically groups with thing. Right, right. So there's some very confusing things. Now, this is a billing thing, and it's the way we currently set the billing.

Now, I know that with the reporting microservice, obviously, we're moving that billing and stuff. But for now, this is just the billing aspect.

So I don't think we need to really go over it too much. It's just what the transaction fee percentage is and then the system minimum fee.

And back on that request type setting I was showing you, that's where you would put the overrides for fees per request type is on the request type setup.

to do that. Thank you. So the clients don't see these things. They don't see the other because we don't want clients to be able to change their fees on the fly.

Yeah, I only think I should be paying a dollar, you know, but we don't give that to them. And that's the system minimum fee.

Now, this additional vendor fee, this is for the banks. So let's say that we're charging a 3% fee to the bank and they want to pass that fee on to the client.

So it shows like it's part of the, right, they would put three. Some banks get savvy and put five.

So they're making 2% on it, right? Same with the request type set fee. It might be $25 for request type from us.

They would put the $25 to pass the fees. Some banks say $30. They want to make them pay five bucks more or whatever it is, right?

So that's what that is. That is for the client. They don't get to set it though. We set it and then it happens site-wide, whether it's based on the request type or it's based on the additional vendor fee here.

Okay, got it. Now, the default setting for my items when you're a bank admin, you have three kinds of roles in our system.

And and you Well, the banks only have two. We're sysadmin and nobody else gets that. You're either a regular user or a bank admin user.

You could be a job manager that is in the appraisal department, but you're a regular user, which means the only difference between a regular user and a bank admin are as such.

They don't get the admin button here, unless there's certain rights assigned to them, which you can assign particular rights like user or vendor management.

So either you're a bank admin and you get all rights to do anything with the glasses, or you're a job manager that's a regular user, and we only give you ability to do vendor management or user management, which just varies on the bank.

[@30:39](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1839.34) \- **Cody Miles**

Can you be an admin and a job manager?

[@30:43](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=1843.2) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Yes, and it's a one user record. You just elevate that user record to be a bank admin. So you're a bank admin, you're a regular user or bank admin, and then you pick the position.

The position can be job manager, they might call it. We might clone it and be a credit analyst, same exact permissions, but they want different names.

So they can see the different departments that go in, right? So you assign roles to a user. And so if anybody that is going to be like a job manager, a lot of them call it appraisal department.

And so they're in the appraisal department. And then they also want a credit analyst. The same exact rules is appraisal department.

They want to identify that they're a credit analyst. They're not processing orders. They're going in for different reasons, right?

So we just make those during the process. Yeah, that's user management. And I doubt we'll get to that. You'll, okay, okay.

But that's another module we'll go through because we have user management, have vendor management, we have a lot of other modules that go into that.

But this particular setting is the My Items checkbox, okay? So when a regular user logs in by default and you go to this main page, every time you click at the top and you're going to this main page right here, it's going to set you back to whatever the default for the system is with your My Items check, right?

So I'm a bank end. So So I don't have my items checked. But if you're a regular user, we'd have my items checked and then you could uncheck it if you have permissions and then you can search and see all things.

Okay. So we asked them, hey, do you want your bank admins to be able to see everything when they go that's in process or do you want them to only see their stuff and then they can uncheck my items?

Most of the time, bank admins want to see all when they go in, regardless of whether they're assigned to it or not.

Right. So that's one setting and that only affects bank admins. Now, this bid engagement panel, when I'm saying a bid engagement panel, what I mean by that is there's a panel that displays on the order for the bid engagement section.

You have to pick a panel. You can't have multiple panels. The only difference is environmental has its own panel and appraisal has its own panel.

Environmental has one panel and that's it. That's the panel you get. We can add different fields on it, but it's on the order form.

And this is the bid engagement panel. Now, you Three options for your bid engagement panel. Once we set it, it sets it for the rest of the time.

You can have the normal bid engagement, which has the same kind of fields, but they're formatted differently. Valuation scenarios, premise scenarios, or premise scenarios four.

So as an example, when I say premise scenarios, this is a normal premise scenarios. If I have premise scenarios four, it would add one more column to this where somebody's picking the interest for break and the qualifier.

Can the user set up custom bid engagement panels?

[@33:30](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2010.52) \- **Cody Miles**

The users don't do it.

[@33:31](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2011.84) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

We do it. The users don't do any setup. Okay.

[@33:35](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2015.58) \- **Cody Miles**

So before, so there's some like kind of back end work to create the different panels that are available for them?

[@33:42](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2022.46) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

No, that's automatic based on this setting. Right. So if I change this setting and save it, it would change it to the other panel.

So we asked them at the beginning when we're going through general settings, what panel they want to use. And then that way we know what other fields we want to add on to the panel.

So we have base panels and then we relabel and do all that. So that's part of the order process.

When we're going through the order, we show them those panels when we get to the bid panel, and we set that in general settings during that time.

Not at the time after we do it. So we set that during the order, but it's here and it's down in here.

And so we have to go find this and set it properly when we're creating the order form for them.

So now you can read what I'm saying. Good Lord, we've just added to this and added to this, never rearranged it, never set it to where it makes sense.

We never updated some of these descriptions. So unless you really know this system, you wouldn't know what to set, right?

Even a portion of NCS is like, , what is this one? All right, final inspection fee field. Good Lord, something's out my window.

So on the final inspection fee field, some banks have a final inspection fee that they want to know, what is that vendor going to charge as a final inspection fee if they do the appraisal and they have to go do a final inspection?

Some banks don't use this field at all. Again, that's a business continuity thing that we We asked the bank to see if they want to do that.

Sometimes they'll test with it and then we shut it off if they don't want to use it. But by default, we never put it on unless they really ask us for a final inspection fee.

You can always turn any of these things on later after they're live. We can go and turn anything on and it'll start working right then, right?

[@35:17](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2117.14) \- **Cody Miles**

Right, right.

[@35:19](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2119.12) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

We ask them, do they want to use business days or calendar days? If they use calendar days, you get every day.

An assignment can be due on a Saturday. If we use business days, we automatically exclude weekends and the bank-specific holidays that they're able to set.

We have a standard set and then the bank can determine if they have additional holidays they don't want to be able to be selected.

So that's what that setting is. Disabled department filters on searches. This is checked, which means we're disabling it. If you had a bank and some banks, the appraisal department does everything, appraisal, environmental, and everything.

Some banks have two departments, specific departments. One does appraisal, one does environmental. So when they log on to the system, all that really means is that.

Everything that we've tagged as environmental when we're setting up the requests, if you go in as the environmental department, your environmental stuff is all going to be automatically highlighted, all of your request types.

And that way you see those, you don't have to see all the commercial appraisal stuff and vice versa. If you're appraisal, the only thing selected are the appraisal ones.

And then you can still uncheck it and see the other jobs if you want. can see environmental jobs if you want, but it just filters their stuff down automatically as a default for them.

Just a dumb question.

[@36:30](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2190.97) \- **Cody Miles**

Do all banks do both environmental and commercial? No.

[@36:35](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2195.57) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

No. It's per bank. Got it. Is it usually they do one or the other or they just do one or both?

No. You'll never find a bank that doesn't, well, no, , better not say that because as soon as I say it, it'll change.

Right. Typically, you'll have a bank that does appraisal and environmental or just appraisal only. It's very rare to see somebody do environmental only, but we do have a client named DCA that does environmental only.

That's why. I said, crap. Never mind. I better stop. So that is the case. could be any combination of.

Now, guys, I want to show you this before I get a whole lot farther, because I know we're going to have a certain amount of time.

Lord of mercy. Hold on. Every time I go and get on a meeting, it logs me out of this thing.

So give me a second. I do have a document that kind of goes through a lot of this stuff for you.

OK, so you're not having to be like. Yeah, great. So this is all of the different settings, right, that we put up and we have of things going through onboarding and questions that we ask and stuff.

So if it's glances, which is the integration that we have for things internal. And so this is all kinds of stuff.

It's a 40 page document that kind of walks you through a lot of the stuff. And here's general settings that we're talking about.

And these are the different settings, screenshots, what we explain to the people and things like that. So I think this will really, really help.

So I'm just kind of giving you a generalized overview. But you can then see what all the settings are, what we set, why we set it, what typical settings are, and everything else like that as you go through these kinds of things.

And then we have other documents for the other modules and stuff like that.

[@38:18](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2298.84) \- **Cody Miles**

So when you're training your CSMs, this is what they're looking at?

[@38:24](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2304.0) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Only specific CSMs. So we have it kind of like, some of them are more on the onboarding and they can do what they always get trained on, how to relabel fields, how to make required fields, how to add drop downs, how to add property categories and types, because those are a different kind of drop down, how to add field templates and things.

This is for the advanced configurers that go in and set those things that have to know a step more than a normal CS, right?

Yeah. And then we have one more layer to that, which is the people who know how to go in studio and configure all of that stuff in studio as well.

Right, right, right. So really that's the advanced configurers usually can do both. We're trying to train some of those up, but.

**ACTION ITEM: Send general settings document from KB to Cody and Val \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2340.9999)**

Still, it's a lot of learning. a long time. whatever we can do to shorten that is what we're looking to do.

So this just goes kind of through the general settings and that's it. So I'll be sending you this document afterwards so that you'll have that.

had to send it over to me from the KB. And then we have other things that'll go through other settings on that.

So that's kind of what I, and let me, as a matter of fact, let me send it to you right now.

So, because I don't know if I have your proper emails. I'm going to advertise. Yeah, let me shut this thing off.

All right. And SN has been my right hand, but SN was taking over all the stuff that I was doing so I could be more on product.

But so that's why you'll get some things from both of us. Either one of us can answer a lot of the questions.

He's still learning some things, but he knows a lot. Okay. All right. So, Cody, I don't think I have your...

Just Cody, yeah.

[@40:01](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2401.28) \- **Cody Miles**

Brandcave.co, C-A-V-E, C-A-V-E, C-A-E.co, that's right, and then Val, same thing, Val, V-A-L, at brandcave.co.

[@40:16](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2416.84) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Gotcha, all right, and I'm going to copy it on this. And we have a bunch of other sections to modules as well, but you're starting to see where the pain point is, I'm hoping, you know what I mean?

It's all painful. Yeah, yeah, and so this is, what it was is, is that you have to think for years, until about four years ago, well, until six years ago, I was the only one doing any of the configurations, any of the other stuff, so when we added something in, didn't matter.

was like, okay, yep, I'm obviously doing all the support, all the onboards, everything. Then we had somebody else that was helping me with some configurations and stuff that was there for a while, and then when she left, after she...

She helped me for about a year and a half. Then Missy came on and then Missy and I became a proficient team in doing it.

And so, but now that we're trying to expand, it's like, oh my gosh. And I can't constantly answer everybody's questions all the time.

And I'm like, oh, this has got to be a simpler way. I've wanted to do this for a long time and just have not had, they haven't given me the capacity or the, you know, go ahead.

So, yeah, yeah. So I'm so frigging excited. You guys can't even imagine. Because it's something that needs to done.

Yeah, you'll see that there's so much things that we can make simpler and put it in the context of where it goes.

And then know that some of it might need to be broken out and sectioned off. know what I mean?

just like you call an overlay over this. This is just one thing after another, right? That makes no sense of the order it's in anymore or anything else.

So as we go through some of these settings, like, you know, date picker for bid reply time. Some people want an actual calendar, but we have a different function.

And and feature that we natively use that we use as a best practice for people is that instead of them having a calendar picker, they say how many days it'll take them from date of engagement to get that report back into you on the web forms.

That comes in at midnight every night. We roll that date so that if somebody waits two weeks to engage a vendor, they know that all of a sudden the system automatically calculate based on business or calendar days when that report will be due.

So that when they're picking it as a job manager or as a lender approving it, they know when to expect that report in.

And the vendor then has the opportunity to accept that assignment or say, no, you waited too long. I'm busy and not accept it.

And they have to go fish again. Right. So, but some banks say, nope, I want to pick the date and I don't want it to roll.

I just want to pick the date and the vendor is going to do it, even though they can do a direct engagement.

They still want it as a date picker on the web forms. Instead, we have a few like that. So we had to make this setting because they're adamant about it.

So every bank has their own set of rules and regulations. And that's why we have a lot of these settings.

Wish they could be standardized. But even if we have two banks using it that way, they're using it regulatory-wise or not necessarily government regulatory-wise, but bank regulatory-wise.

That is their reason they have it. Some of these, I'm like, I don't want this configuration, but you have to do it because that bank needs it that way or they can't be on your system, right?

Yeah, yeah. So it's those kinds of things like that. So enable estimated total completion date. This is a functionality where we have to enable it in a couple of different places.

And what this does is it gives an added notification to lenders. So once the vendors engage, if the job manager extends the time because the vendor says I can't get access to the property or something, right?

And they change the date, it sends out a notification to lending and it updates and shows it's delayed in the system so that everybody's aware.

And then every time, if a number of days for review changes, it automatically updates and tells everybody. So some banks want that.

Some banks say, no, I don't want my lenders to be that notified. So that's. Is that a function feature set that we can turn on or off?

When you put a request on hold, nobody can edit it except for, you know, it's just on hold. Lenders never can edit it when it's on hold.

You can always make a comment. You can upload additional documents, but you can't edit any of the criteria. So this allows a JM or a bank admin to edit on hold.

Some banks only want bank admins to edit on hold. Some banks don't want anybody. Some banks want a job manager, but nobody ever wants a lender.

So that's why that functionality is there. Um, enable review approval. It's a button that gets added to the order, uh, that they have an option to send it for review or not send it for review.

Uh, after the standard review comes in, some want to review approval. Some don't. This turns on or off that button and it gives a little section of fields that'll display or not display.

So that functionality is tied to that with the checkbox being checked. Mm-hmm. Uh, enable review due date required. If you do this, then the...

That means that when they hit accept a review internally to the bank, you know, because when they assign it out to somebody externally, they have to put in a due date, right?

They know they did and all that, it gets handled. But if they're accepting it like as a job manager and they're doing the review internally, it forces them to put in a review due date because they always forget to do so.

And then nobody knows when the review is going to be done. So that is a pop up that pops up and they have to put in a review date in order to accept the review assignment.

Some banks want that, some banks don't. We always now disable login as. So we have the ability to assume another user in the system.

It used to be that we let bank admins assume other users in the system, but we have some banks that are like, I absolutely don't want any of my users to assume another user even if they're an admin.

Some banks do. So it's a mix. So we had to add that configuration in in order to accommodate the mix for both.

So this is a new function feature where it says you can. And that's just that Enables certain fields to be updated after order is completed because when an order is completed, the only person who can edit a completed order is a bank admin.

No lenders, no job managers, nobody else can. That's the difference is for a bank admin. It's the only functionality difference, really, a bank admin has when it comes to the normal screens other than the admin stream, right?

Right. So on this, we can add specific fields that we put in a layout that says anybody, a lender or anybody, job manager can edit these specific fields and it'll update the order.

So when they click the button, it pops up two fields, three fields, and they can edit those even after our order is completed because it might be whether they got the loan or not.

It might be the value change or some other thing that they want them to be able to edit or update after it's been completed.

And that gives us access to do that. And we only put the fields they want on there. So that enables that functionality.

And then we have to do the configuring for it. Okay.

[@47:00](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2820.07) \- **Cody Miles**

So as you can see, we.

[@47:01](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2821.5) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Still have all of these settings, all of these settings, hide or not. We have vendor credentialing settings. We have list view settings.

So there is still a lot more settings in here. So that's why I said the document will help out with quite a few of those.

I think we have most of it in there. Some we may not on these bottom styles, but we can take a look at that.

That I think is a big enough challenge at first for somebody to try and whip this into a little bit better shape.

I have an interface here, and then we can go to the next module. Unless you guys tell me, hey, I want 20 modules at once.

I just don't know that that would be productive, right? Do you mind if I give you kind of a frame of reference for how I'm thinking about the problem?

[@47:46](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2866.8) \- **Cody Miles**

Yes.

[@47:47](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2867.74) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

That'd be great. I'm going share my screen for just a moment. Let me see yours. Almost there. Okay, let me know when you can see.

[@48:08](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2888.24) \- **Cody Miles**

So what I don't want you to get caught up on here is the UI design because this was just kind of vibe coded out as a proof of concept.

The real thing here is being designed by a designer on the team and it's for a different client, that kind of thing.

But it's an onboarding flow for a company where the, you know, similar but way less settings, someone needs to go set up their account and configure their account.

so basically they're invited into the software via email. They accept their invite. They set their password. They authenticate. And then in their first time user experience, they're now in an onboarding state.

They actually can't do anything else in the software until they complete at least the first module of the onboarding state.

Is that making sense so far? Uh-huh.

[@48:56](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2936.08) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

And just tell me where you disagree with any of this. You would never have this per user in our system.

Okay. So it would never be a per user. This is per bank. So these settings that we're talking about right now is setting up for the bank itself.

So it's usually a department that's agreeing on that to do so. Now, there could be one person in charge.

Yes. Yeah. And that's what I'm trying to get at. Yeah. Yeah.

[@49:19](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2959.69) \- **Cody Miles**

This is obviously a different use case in a different world, but there's someone who's your point of contact within the bank who will be responsible for providing the inputs, right?

Correct.

[@49:29](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2969.39) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Okay.

[@49:30](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=2970.07) \- **Cody Miles**

So they get invited to the software, they accept their invitation, and now they are going to set up the account on behalf of the bank.

And they'll do it in conjunction with other collaborators, you know, other things like this. But they're the ones doing the inputs.

So they get kind of introduced into what they're about to do from a, like, we're about to set up your account.

And this is a very light account setup in comparison to yours. But basically, then they go through a stepper flow.

And this is very much in the UX pattern of type form, which takes the... The approach based on a lot of research that you break up forms into like a couple questions per page and that helps the user not get overwhelmed as they're doing things right.

And so you kind of heuristically group certain certain settings. In your world, it actually might be a little different where it's like you select some inputs that tells the system what kind of user you are.

And then we we refill a lot of values for you to confirm rather than create settings.

[@50:30](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3030.24) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

It would be. It can't be based on any kind of user. It's the bank. I'm saying I'm saying user, but we're setting up.

yeah. Is what I'm trying to say. What kind of account you are.

[@50:41](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3041.32) \- **Cody Miles**

And then it pre-fills a lot of values based on, you know, some basic questions where we kind of figure out what kind of, you know, does your bank do environmental orders?

Does it do commercial orders? And so now like we were asking some higher level questions that actually have downstream impacts.

Right. Right. so that's kind of how. I'm imagining your scenario. That's not what's happening here. What's happening here is very straightforward questions of like, tell me the name of your company or whatever.

But in this world, that would be crazy if we get embed videos.

[@51:13](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3073.65) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

And what I mean by that is walkthroughs like, hey, if you're my items is checked, the screen will do this.

If you're my items is not checked, the screen will do this and explain the difference. And then that way they can make an educated decision.

Because they're not going to be able to understand with just text. You know what I mean? They'll never get it because they have to see the example and understand.

And we want to tell them at the beginning, this is your initial configuration. If during testing you want any of these changed or adjusted, we can always change and adjust those things.

So that's what we tell them at the beginning. Don't don't get an aneurysm over the decisions. Yeah. Yeah. love it.

Because we can change them. Right. We can change those decisions. But we want to get a basic setup done as fast as we possibly can to get you tested because you don't know what you don't know.

And then we will conform to what you need to have. Right. We can go back and change some of these things.

So. Right. Right. Right. Right. It's that appraisal group on that and that bank that'll get together in order to make these decisions to all sit together.

And instead of sitting on the phone with us, they can have a meeting on their teams and walk through the settings and watch the video and make the determination.

How do we want this to work for our side? Do we want this or not? Right. So that would be like, you know, you click here to see the functionality and then you make your choice.

And some of that stuff, that's that's what it would be. You know what I mean? So things like drop downs, then that is totally different.

We'll be able to let them just go through those kinds of things. That's yeah, that's right.

[@52:36](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3156.84) \- **Cody Miles**

So just kind of taking this a little step further here. What I'm doing in this software is we ask some super high level questions like we do this, this and this as our services is for a landscape management software company.

And then there's QuickBooks integration. We'll skip that. And then based on that earlier input, then we're like, OK, you said you did, you know, snow and maintenance and projects.

So we're going to we're going to give you these default values for And then we're going to educate you on what divisions are because, you know, you're a landscape owner operator.

You have no idea what divisions are in QuickBooks, right? And so this is that education section where, like, maybe there's a video here.

We're pre-filling values for you based on what we know about you and then allowing you to be like, no, we don't do this and we don't do this, right?

[@53:19](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3199.56) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Yep. Yep. And then add a division. I see that. Yeah, perfect.

[@53:23](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3203.46) \- **Cody Miles**

Right. Right. You got it.

[@53:26](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3206.2) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

That would work for our web types perfectly. Beautiful.

[@53:30](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3210.44) \- **Cody Miles**

Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, exactly. We kind of pre-fill the request types. allow them to kind of drill down in the request types, configure them, or confirm the settings of the request type that we're giving them out of the box.

But mostly just encouraging them like, hey, we kind of, we've done this a lot. We've seen a lot of people like you and here's what your setting should be, right?

Right.

[@53:50](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3230.6) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

And some banks want get really granular and some want to generic so they can exit all the ones they don't want.

We can put everything we know, soup to nuts for all the request types. Hey, these are examples of request types.

Which ones do you want? Right. Yep. Okay. Thank Yes, yes.

[@54:03](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3243.11) \- **Cody Miles**

And Val, hope you're paying close attention here, because this is the UX pattern I want for you.

[@54:07](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3247.95) \- **Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)**

Sure, Cody. I know you are. Okay.

[@54:11](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3251.03) \- **Cody Miles**

So we have the inputs, and we have default values on the inputs, and then we have videos and educational pieces that are explaining what the inputs do and what they mean.

Right. Same thing here. then you can see, so the terms and conditions for your proposals, and so that's what's also happening here.

And then check this out. This is when they add their users. We'll say we're adding, you know, Val, and we put in Val's email.

[@54:37](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3277.01) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

that's a user import for us, so that you know, we have a user import, and we have a workbook that we give them.

So this is where we would give them the workbook and tell them how to do it. You give them the template, they fill it out, they re-import it, we make sure it's all good.

it to us, and we import it. Yep, they give it to us, and we import it, because there's some things we have to do on our side for the import.

We don't let them do the import of the users or vendors, but we do have to have a section to show them and give them that spreadsheet, which the spreadsheet would need to update.

[@55:02](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3302.68) \- **Cody Miles**

Okay, that makes sense. Cool. So we do a bulk import for users. And then here there's like booking your training, which we could absolutely do in your case too.

It's like as soon as you complete the first set of things, maybe, you know, as a P1 for us in implementing the software, maybe there's like, we need you to fill out these basic things and then let's do your strategy call and kind of figure out, you know, some other stuff.

But we could skip that too. We get some sort of confirmation. We get confetti. We make them feel seen and heard, right?

They completed something we wanted them to do. And then what happens after that is within the software, in this software, at least the way it's modeled here, we have a getting started section.

And in fact, in some places, we've actually gated you from using the software until you do the next module to set up your account.

[@55:51](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3351.88) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

We would absolutely want. They can't use any parts of it until they finish the whole setup part. They finish the whole thing.

Cool. So we have like module one set.

[@56:01](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3361.79) \- **Cody Miles**

And then you have basically your, this is the next module we want you to do. And then, you know, you, you have these other modules we want you to do too, essentially, right?

These onboarding steps.

[@56:12](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3372.35) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

So, you know, okay, cool.

[@56:13](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3373.39) \- **Cody Miles**

We need to do module two. And, you know, this is maybe doing our routing, right? Once we have our request set up, or this is maybe setting up our, like maybe, maybe module one is just like setting up the account defaults in general settings and users, right?

And module two is setting up, you know, our request types. So, and module three is setting up the routing for request types.

So, you get the sense of it, right? And so, like now we're on module two and we're doing the stepper there.

The user doesn't have to do all of the modules at one point, but we have basically within the software a getting started screen that helps them see where they're at in the process, what still needs to be done, what they've completed.

And then every step of the way.

[@56:52](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3412.79) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

So, that would tell them how long they have for each section. Cool. You know, some, some deadlines. onboard. Yep.

[@56:59](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3419.93) \- **Cody Miles**

Very cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely agree.

[@57:02](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3422.46) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Now, again, all of those settings have to then go be set, right? So even at the beginning, we're not going to have the development for all of those settings to automatically be set.

Or, you know, like the user import workbook. I don't know how fancy we can get with that because it changes column headers and things like that.

But just give them an explanation and for them to download it and give them an assignment status and they have to have it uploaded by a certain date.

That would be great. And then we have to talk to them about it because there's always some some some back and forth.

But you have to have your user position set up before you can give them that. So it'll have to go in the order of what, you know, what would make sense.

But even if we can cut down on, you know, a lot of the general config, like here's the standard property screen.

Tell us what you want to take out and what fields you're missing and what kind of field do you want it to be?

And they could pick those things. So, I mean, there's so much we can do with it. You know, it would really help.

Yeah. Yeah. You know, we just got a printout and we had to go do it afterwards. It would still be easier than being on the phone with them.

Thank To say those same things over and over and over, it's like, oh my God, really? Yeah, yeah.

[@58:08](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3488.44) \- **Cody Miles**

So I'm imagining for you, there's one user that becomes a point of contact that's going to fill in all the inputs and otherwise do this.

Or a team.

[@58:18](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3498.34) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

So any of them can, yeah, on behalf of that person. Sure, sure.

[@58:21](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3501.42) \- **Cody Miles**

As long as you don't get into a race conflict. But then, you know, essentially they have a isolated experience within the software where they have to complete each module in the order that we want them to complete each module before they can get into the software and otherwise use it.

Along the way, have, you know, like you can see here, there's modeled out some like training videos of like, here's what this module is about and here's what you're about to do.

Here's how long you should expect to take to do this module. And then you have basically a stepper flow for, you know, each one of those modules, right?

Yeah. And from my end of things, what, you know, you're the subject matter expert here. And so what I could really use some help on is determining like, what are the highlights?

Level questions, I can ask someone an example of which being like, do you do commercial? Do you do environmental?

**ACTION ITEM: Vibe code proof of concept for RealWired onboarding flow, similar to example shown \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3553.9999)**

And if I know those things, then I can set a whole bunch of defaults on their behalf. You're going to give me your spreadsheet or your document from the KB there.

I'll understand better what the inputs are. And then, you know, Val, I'll work with you. I think we should vibe code out a proof of concept here before going into design, just very similar to what I'm showing here.

**ACTION ITEM: Ask Missy to send current and refined onboarding process docs to Cody and Val \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3569.9999)**

So that we can kind of start figuring out what the functional requirements are before we start getting into like spending time in design and doing discovery and design.

[@59:39](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3579.69) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Exactly. The other thing I can give you guys is we have like an onboarding process that we give the clients that tells them what steps we're going to take and whatnot and stuff.

So I will ask Missy to get that over to you guys. And they're refining it right now as well.

So at least you guys will have an idea of kind of how the steps in the process. That's amazing.

**ACTION ITEM: Connect with Val to align on approach for RealWired onboarding flow proof of concept \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3603.9999)**

what background What they're doing now, and then as it's being refined. So I will tell her, whatever we give to the clients now, let's give it over to you guys.

**ACTION ITEM: Sync with Cody re approach for RealWired onboarding flow proof of concept before working on project \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3603.9999)**

Okay. So I will tell that. Beautiful. All right.

[@1:00:14](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3614.32) \- **Cody Miles**

Well, Val, let's, you and I, before you work on RealWire next, or at least on this project, let's connect and make sure we're both aligned on the approach.

We'll take in those context documents from you, Sunda, and we'll start putting things together for just consideration.

[@1:00:28](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3628.34) \- **Sunda Scanlon**

Okay. Perfect. That's great. All right. Thank you. All right. Thanks, guys. appreciate you.

[@1:00:33](https://fathom.video/share/ydVjDAqtbPvBS9hyzu3JBffd6SkBzbJi?timestamp=3633.82) \- **Cody Miles**

I appreciate you. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye, guys.
