0:00 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  It's such a wonderful place, definitely worth seeing.



0:06 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Hey, Cody.



0:10 - Cody Miles

  There you guys are. I think my internet might be bad. Can you hear me okay?



0:15 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Yes.



0:16 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  you want to go off-cam to save some bandwidth?



0:21 - Cody Miles

  Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.



0:24 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Did you go to 011 back? I did. Dude, it was so great, actually.



0:31 - Cody Miles

  I've only been to two now. Yeah. And this year, I think, was actually much better than last year. And last year was good, too, but it was really good this year.  What was the difference? Part of it is so much about the environment, right? Everyone was just in a really great mood.  The speakers were all great. They're all kind of like speeches focused on culture. We leadership, so it's not as technical as I might have hoped for if I were going to a tech conference.  But, I mean, it was really well organized, and the venue was, I don't know if you've ever, have you spent time in San Diego?  Yeah, I've been to San Diego, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We were on this, anyway, it was a really great venue.  We saw Kenny G. It's a real year. Yeah, yeah, so we could. That's awesome, man.



1:29 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  And I think you also kind of get to know the players, right? You know, you know more people than when you originally started, I'm sure.  Yeah, that's a great point.



1:40 - Cody Miles

  And, you know, as a vendor, because we sponsored the event, we did come out of it with some proper leads, and, you know, a couple might even close this week, so that's really cool.  Wow, dude, look at that. It's paying dividends. Yeah, absolutely. So, I'm grateful for it. That's awesome, man.



2:01 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Yeah, I just got bumped. I just saw all the updates on Slack, and I'm just honestly so jealous.



2:08 - Cody Miles

  I can't believe I didn't make it. Oh, yeah. But you were doing fun things, so it's all good. I was, I was.



2:14 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  But you know how many messages I got back saying, like, Ed, where the  are you? I think it's because I'm known to bring the party when I'm there.



2:27 - Cody Miles

  I think that's absolutely true.



2:31 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Are we waiting for Sundar? What are we doing today?



2:37 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  I'm not sure if Sundar had the meeting invite for this meeting for this week. Okay.



2:44 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  No worries. I am, I am super stoked. I have heard the most amazing things about the overlay project. You know, I think from three different people, everybody has just been saying, like, how great it is.  I was. even got a message when I was in Japan about, like, what phenomenon. I'm going to work you guys are doing.  Oh, good. Everybody has been, you know, extremely excited. They showcased this to the leadership team, I think, a couple of days ago.  They were, like, absolutely smashed about us. The consultant that's actually working with us right now on doing, implementing this, the workbooks, they just mentioned to us that they think they should stop doing the workbooks and we should just put all of our efforts in doing this.  Hell yeah.



3:27 - Cody Miles

  Yeah. Wow, that's such a big deal. Yeah, that's massive.



3:32 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Suddenly, you know, like, this was the project that's going to gain us visibility and it did. So, yeah, good, good.



3:39 - Cody Miles

  Well, you know, I think the approach we're taking here and this is, you know, we're all kind of learning the new skill of how to do product discovery with five coding.  But the thing that we got out of this is we were able to move really quickly through a lot of complex requirements and iterate in a way that, you know, took weeks instead of months, that's right.  Yeah. So that's why. What I feel like has been the biggest unlock. I think we still have to do the UX work and properly hand it off to the dev team for implementation.  But I think we have, you know, Val's done a good job of listening, getting the requirements from Sunda, interpreting what Sunda's saying in her documents and turning it into something that actually makes sense.  Yeah. Yeah. So question, how much of this have you seen? No, I haven't seen anything of the new stuff.



4:32 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  cool. All right.



4:34 - Cody Miles

  Maybe it's worth just kind of spending just a couple of minutes going through it then just to get your validation.

  ACTION ITEM: Share sandbox URL w/ Ed; then Ed review sandbox - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=277.9999  Please, please do. Yeah. Okay. All right. Val, I'll let you take it from here.



4:44 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Sure, Cody. Good news, Ed. Whatever I have built here on the wide-coded version, we have a URL. You can later look at it and introspect on your own time.  But in the meanwhile, I'll just showcase what we have been building. This is essentially a sandbox. This And then I have been brainstorming and, you know, got the entire flow ready or the components there.  So essentially what you have right now are two applications or two phases of the application. One would be the client onboarding.  The other one would be the Uconnect CS portal. So on the client onboarding, that's how we're going to start.  And when the client receives an application, what they're going to see is a Uconnect onboarding hub page. They'll start with their heading.  They have some notifications, their sign-in account, and the product goal update as a banner on top. Starting with their first step, which is the organization setup, the module one, and assigned to the primary manager here.  So there are other modules that user has visibility what they're going to be doing, but only one is unlocked at this time because this is a dependent, you know, module.  So let's start with the first one, setting up their organization. So from... From our very previous call, like the last call we were with, we took in the feedback and kind of made it in a way that it starts with the organization name has already been set, and the primary contact has been sent this invite for the application from the CS agent.  So what they can do is they can go ahead and start building their custom URL. We can see the changes and what the preview is going to be like.  There is some education component here with the video tutorial and some resources. The next page would be uploading their organization logo.  So user could go ahead and upload their logo. And we're going to see multiple sizes that we're going to be using this logo in and select the singular brand color.  And then have a quick preview on what the, you the elements of the design of the website are going to look like.  They can skip that for now or they can continue doing that. skip that for now. And the primary onboarding manager is already set.  Now they can add additional participants into that, just some examples here, but they can always add new participants with their email, and select a role just for, you know, labeling and tagging who's exactly that's going to be.  They can also do bulk upload of all the participants if they have a list with these elements in there.

  ACTION ITEM: Implement invite links for additional participants - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=439.9999



7:25 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Just, can I give feedback as we go? Sure. Let's just do action for, I'm just thinking about, like, anyone with this link, you know, just send them an invite link.



7:42 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  So you're going to see on the CS portal flow that it's going to be sent to just the one primary, you know, onboarding manager.  They're the ones who's going to be able to open this application at the beginning. Yeah, yeah, yeah.



7:53 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  But I'm thinking, like, if someone is adding their additional participants, you know, rather than typing. I'm thinking everybody's... email, just giving them a link that they can copy and paste to whoever.  Okay. Yeah, yeah. So you still add them, but then you just give them an authenticated link so they can kind of create your account.



8:09 - Cody Miles

  Right. Okay.



8:15 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  The final page or the step in this module is going to be authentication methods. If the user were to do a single sign-on method, they're going to download a configuration guide.  Depending on that, like they're going to update, select their integration type, and upload the certificates that's needed for this SSO.  But if they want to go the standard authentication route, they can select their password requirements, cat requirements, login lockout options.  And they can also set IP restrictions to other singular IPs. They can also do the session time mode where they can give the duration of the session.  Also inactivity warnings can be said. The two activity warnings that currently are supported. Okay. And yeah, that would complete the first step, which would take the user into opening up the rest of the modules.  This is where user can see other modules that are opened up and they can start assigning any other participants that have previously filled out who they want to be completing this.

  ACTION ITEM: Show all modules in client hub; gray out unassigned - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=555.9999  And whichever participant wants to take on the module can open that up and start doing it. I guess at this point, I can ask you this question.  Would you like this hub to be visible exclusively to the primary manager and just the modules that are assigned to be visible?  That's a thing we can do.



9:42 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Meaning that you can only see the modules that you're assigned to? No, I think honestly, if I look at like all the modules, like they will never be 300.  Like it will always be, you know, five or 10 or whatever that is. What I kind of like about having them visible to everybody, maybe you.  can't start them and edit them if you don't have the rights, but what I like about having them visible to you is the fact that maybe I can phone up John and say, hey, you know, I can do this.  Just assign me to it, you know, and so it allows for that person to discover and to actually help accelerate the project rather than just I've got one thing in my queue and effectively I'm seeing a very empty list, you know, and I'm not actually feel a part of the project.  Having that global view, you know, with it's grayed out because I don't have access just means that I need to phone up the right person and get access if I can move this along.  But at least it gives me that feeling that I'm part of the process and part of the project that I can understand the steps, you know, involved.  Yeah. That sounds good.



10:46 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Like the primary onboarding is going to track everything anyway, but it makes sense that everybody has a visual view of what's happening.  Yeah. So quickly going to the next module, which is the definitions, and this is where the user is going to start.  No doubt. Defining what their property categories and types are, we're going to give them a list. This is a bit exhaustive list.  It can just be like Westinstein commercial, but it is like Sun has mentioned that they could have a custom list of category types.  So you could go ahead and change the labels of the category type or delete them and add the types of the properties within the category and add them.



11:24 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  And they can also add your property categories.



11:27 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Once they have set the property category, now is the time for configuring the fields of, you know, a property record.  Starting with the field labels, like such as street address. These are the ones that are system required and they can at best change the labels.  So they're going to be disabled in that way. But there are other, you know, like... it... No, sorry.



11:51 - Cody Miles

  For some reason, your screen stopped sharing for me, but then it came back. So it must have just been me.  Yeah, it's just you.



11:58 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Thank you.



12:00 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Okay. All right. So the other kind of fields are the ones that you can check off and you don't need them, or you can change the label, and also kind of create the input type.  Currently, I'm just supporting a few input types like text inputs and drop downs, where if you have selected a drop down, have a list of drop down options that you can manage.  There might be others like date picker, etc. As soon as I get the list, I'll update them here on the design as well.  But yeah, once the user gets to configure all the property type, I mean, fields, to what to show and what not to show, they can want to do this request.  Yeah.



12:39 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  So just go back one. Okay. I'm just trying to, because, you know, this onboarding step is new to me as well.  So I'm just trying to see if it would make sense to me, just like getting to this page and understand what I need to do.  I actually have no idea what I'm supposed to do. Yeah, know, kind of like I land on this page and I'm like, okay, you know, I have this, you know, labels and I can select if it's required and I can select the input type, but I'm not quite sure what I'm building.  You know, now I do understand that I've got the content on the left that's going to kind of like help me, you know, navigate that.  But I'm still, I kind of still feel, if you show me this, even if after I watch the video, I'm at this stage, I'm experiencing a little bit of information anxiety, just given like there's a lot of fields, like a 16 of 23 that I need to go through and I don't want to  this up.  So something like, you know, something that might make me feel a little bit better, and I'm just, you know, bringing this up, but something that might make me feel a little bit better is if I had a visual indicator of what's actually happening on the right hand side.  So let's say I make a change and I call that field. Lab or something else, you know, if I can see what it's going to represent, what it's actually going to do in the system, oh, now I feel very comfortable editing it because I know I'm actually building this form, right?  I have that visual that's assisting me the whole time. So just reducing the information anxiety a bit, you know.



14:22 - Cody Miles

  That makes sense. And my first thought was like, okay, we have an educational sidebar and we're expecting it to do a lot for the user.  Yeah. There are additional just small UX things we could do where, you know, like in-app product tours is just a very small example that we could say, you know, this is a system required field for street address.  However, you are able to change the label, right? Right. Right. But I think that's an interesting idea. So basically for the form that you're updating, you just want to like visually show the inputs of it.  Yeah. Yeah.



15:00 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  And I, and I, and I feel like, you know, what that kind of gives you is it gives you, you know, this user, you know, because what you're telling them is, is bold this input form on this piece of paper.  Right. But I have no idea, you know, what it's going to look like, how it's going to be read, you know, what's going to happen.



15:19 - Cody Miles

  Yeah. Yeah.



15:20 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  And so just giving them that like, Hey, Oh, okay. I see if I changed the label here, you know, it changes it on the first page, you know, like on this section.



15:29 - Cody Miles

  Yeah.



15:30 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  I see if I've got a drop down. Oh, okay. This is what they select. And so, um, maybe these are the three things that I need to be grouped together.  Or maybe these are the three things that I want to have read only, you know, and you can, you can show that, you know, visually to them because like that helps me fill out this form fast.  Um, because now I'm visualizing how people are going to use it, not, Oh , I need to put in all of this information and I hope I  do it.

  ACTION ITEM: Prototype live-preview form builder; present to Sundar - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=949.9999  Right. Um, you know, it'd be a cool.



16:00 - Cody Miles

  The pattern here, Val, I don't know if you're familiar with like form building tools like Gravity Forms or, you know, I actually don't know if Typeform works like this or not, but basically like an interface where you see the form and you can select the inputs to configure them.



16:15 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Yeah, that would be so killer, you know, yeah, if we can do that. Yeah, we'll need to check with Sondra in of just to see what limitations we have, but if we have that and it's like, hey, you know, build this thing and have fun and experience it and experiment with it, you know, that's so much of a better state than, you know, do this, right, click next, and, you know, whatever you selected here is now going to be the beginning all and end all of the process, yeah.



16:47 - Cody Miles

  So, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, I really, actually, I really like that. So, Val, if you're not familiar, then, you know, the pattern is, you know, you have the form in front of you kind of shown as.  If it's the real form, but you can select the inputs and basically pulls out a drawer that's allowing you to manage the input.  You can change the placeholder text or the label or the, you know, the property type. And yeah, if you need to, you can add properties.  You just kind of drag and drop from available property types onto the form builder. It's a pretty common pattern, actually.  So yeah, I mean, I think that's worth experimenting with. Like, I think we should probably just very quickly vibe code it out and present that to Sunda as like, hey, is this a feasible approach?  Because otherwise it might be a little abstract to try to communicate. Yeah. That sounds fair. Cool.



17:42 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Thanks for that note, Ed. Moving on to request types, you would see the similar behavior here. They would set up the request categories.  And of course, like, given the limitation of the UConnect form, we only support three categories right now. So environmental appraisal as examples, if they're going to change, they can change.  It's that as well, but they can add one more custom one, whether it's construction or miscellaneous or something like that.  They can go ahead and add new request types, select the process, like whether it's going to be one step or two step for this category of request types, and save those changes.  We should take them, of course, to the similar configuration of the request form fields with system required properties that can't be changed.  The fields that can be changed or checked off, change of input types, and, of course, the ability to add more custom fields.  And the user can select if they want to mark it as a required field there as well for their user.  And finally, in the definitions page, corresponding to the request, we have the engagement panel configuration. And this is where we have a preset of four engagement panels that users will be able to see.  So what we are going to And this is pixelated, but yeah, the original screenshots would have better resolution to understand what exactly the user is going to be building when they select one of these options.  And depending on the selector panel, they'll be able to customize the panel fields again. Similar pattern here as well.  And able to add new custom fields. For now, for the user, for the client that has environmental orders as well, we enable them with one optional, you know, engagement panel, which is environmental orders, and they can do the same over here.  And that would finish up their definitions module, leading them to user setup, vendors, and routing. User setup is, I'm like waiting on send us input, it is a placeholder right now, so I'll skip it, you're probably.

  ACTION ITEM: Add per-module review/summary; enable edit-back - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=1198.9999



20:04 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  You know, I just want to, while we are back here, can we go back? I was thinking about, like, I know you had your congratulations, your done screen.  I think what we just need to do is, before we get there, is you kind of need to just review it with them, you know, because effectively, you know, stepping all the way through to the end, you've made a lot of changes here, know, and these changes are, you know, they're complex.  You know, you've built some forms, you know, you've chosen some options, you know. I think before we show you, know, definitions is complete, or like, even on this page, you need to just do the review of them.  Hey, this is what you've selected, right? And then maybe just that guidance of, like, you know, feel free to change it, you know, it's not locked in yet, or whatever that is, because, like, you want to...  Give someone peace of mind. What you've just done is you've built a couple of complex forms. You've chosen configurations.  You know, it's kind of a big deal. You want to have them feel confident in that choice. You know, so give them this ability to say, this is what you've selected.  Let's just review it. You know, this is what it means. And then say, cool, you're done. Let's continue, you know, moving on.  Lock it in. Do you want to edit it? Go back. You know, that kind of stuff. That makes sense.



21:32 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  Originally, I was thinking that would happen after all modules. But it makes sense since modules are long enough. So some of you have configuration.



21:40 - Cody Miles

  feel the pressure, though. It's like, oh, it's complete. Does that mean I can't change it now? Yeah. Yeah.



21:46 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you want to, like for me, for me, this onboarding flow is something that likes the customer.  You know, I know it's big decisions, but I want them to feel, you know, the ability. it. to really go back and forth and change things and have these discussions in the departments and really think about their processes.  know, the way that we've been doing it, and I feel like the way why it's not moving as fast is because it's so locked in that, you know, there's just so much pressure that nothing can be done unless the committee decides on it, you know.  And this just means that things move slowly because now I need seven people to agree about definitions in the room.  You know, while I feel what we are building here is a much more iterative approach. Hey, John, I took stab one at it.  You know, this is what I thought. Could you just review and look at it? You know, and he can look in and he can make some changes.  Hey, Sam, you forgot to add this field. Don't worry, I added it. You know, that's how you move fast in this world.  I feel like getting away from this committee approach and giving them that sense of like, hey, you know, it's set up, move on.  Yeah. This is what you've done. This is what it looks like. It's a really cool way of doing it.  You know, even having, I know we've got the edit button there, but even doing like, oh, this one is completed.  There's a review button and you can just press on the review button and get that summary page, you know, that last page for.  So even if I'm not assigned to this, I can review it and I can have that confidence about like how this is set up, which can guide me into my task, you know?

  ACTION ITEM: Consult Sundar re: review/approval cycles; decide whether to implement - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=1397.9999



23:28 - Cody Miles

  What you were saying made me think, is it worth thinking through like adding like approval or review cycles? So like someone is assigned to it, they complete it, and then this other person is assigned as like the second reviewer, where they get prompted to then say, okay, like John finished organization set up and you've been assigned to now, you know, review and confirm.



23:54 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  Yeah, love that idea. I just don't want to make that call without missing your head of CS, know, head of onboarding.  You know, she would know a little bit more. Yeah, But I do kind of, I like that approach. What I would just say from a hesitance perspective is, you know, that does force you into a potential pattern of like just slower acceptance cycles.  Yeah. So I would just be careful with that. But nonetheless, like for me, it's give them the ability to see the progress and review and the ability to always go back and change it.  And that way, you know, they can sort that out themselves. But at least what we do is we facilitate this information anxiety.  That's what I want to get away from. Like I know this is a big deal, but I don't want information anxiety as part of like this onboarding process.  I want people to feel, , this is easy and so convenient and not like, oh, my gosh, this was such a hassle and I'm so afraid of change.  Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.



24:55 - Cody Miles

  Yeah, it makes sense also not to just prescribe a workflow where they might. They not even need a second reviewer or whatever.  Exactly, yeah. I get it, yeah. I just want to bring it to your notice, like this is client phasing.



25:08 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)

  So all the onboarding participants are the client team. Yeah. But we always have the CS portal module. guess we can do some assignment or reconfiguration, which I think, given the lack of time, I'll jump through that.  You can always look at what the other modules look like. absolutely. So on the CS portal side, what we have are the list of client onboarding that's currently happening or maybe recently finished.  So the agent would be able to see a list of all clients, their initiation dates, the current status, the progress, the go live dates, and tracking status whether they're behind or on track.  And any tickets they have raised corresponding to a single on, you know. So they can go ahead and add a new client, a new client that just joined, and we want to onboard them.  So we do the primary onboarding contact for the... Hank has said that it's going to be and set a preliminary go-live date, which is, of course, can be changed.  So adding a new client, we'll open up that client module for the CS agent, where they essentially have the capability to change their go-live date if something changes.  But there are all the modules now with each of those steps as tabs waiting for the client input. They can send reminders, which they could be able to see in the notifications on the client portal.  So all the modules, all the steps, everything they can expect that the CS agent can probably look at and even configure from their end, they'll be able to see.  For example, if we were to see one of the clients, Union Bank, so they were able to see that they have set up their custom URL, they added their logo, they have the onboarding participants, their IT configuration has been set.  And similarly, like whatever we have seen for the vendors, all those elements would be here.



28:00 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  I think, like, one thing, you know, just before we wrap up, because I have to jump, is if you go back to just the landing page here, like all the way to the first one when you select the modules.

  ACTION ITEM: Hide CS Portal from client-facing landing - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=1684.9999  Oh, okay. So what I would say is because the CS portal is really like a, you know, back-end login, like, I mean, my team is going to use that.  I don't need, you know, someone from this organization to see that. Could you just log out so that we can see, you know, you select that first?  Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, like, seeing the Uconnect CS portal, you know, and being able to click on it, I mean, that does nothing for the customer.  But this is only for us.

  ACTION ITEM: Add CS contact info to client onboarding hub - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/cr1jz865gLC8mvz9zqTTg_r7G97R4JaL?timestamp=1722.9999



28:44 - Cody Miles

  This is just a nice screen. Okay.



28:46 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  So in terms of, like, this screen, would we ever show this to the customer?



28:51 - Cody Miles

  No. Never, never. Okay.



28:53 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)

  So then what we would do is if the customer goes into day one, the client onboarding application, can we just open up that one?  Yeah. I would love for it to some way you say, this is your customer success team, this is the person you're talking to, this is the contact information, you know, just having some sort of like connection with us as the organization.  That makes sense. Cool, but this is excellent work, I can see why everybody is ranting and raving, like it's been really getting a lot of attention, and so, you know, people are loving it.  So we might double down on pushing this through with an even higher priority, so I'm super happy to hear that, yeah.

  All right, well, we've made some edits, well, I've written down some revisions. We'll continue kind of vibing this out as a way to figure out the functional requirements, and also Val is working on the quote-unquote real design for the developer.  Yeah.
