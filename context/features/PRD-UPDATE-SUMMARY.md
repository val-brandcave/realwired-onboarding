## Key Implementation Patterns Documented

### 1. State Management
- **Global Context**: `OnboardingContext` via `OnboardingProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Update Functions**: `updateBankProfile`, `updateGuidedSetup`, `updateFeatureEducation`, `updateFirstValue`, `updateRetention`, `updateTemplates`, `updateTimers`
- **Navigation Functions**: `goToStep`, `markStepComplete`, `canProceed`
- **Component Local State**: Used for UI-only concerns (modals, loading states, validation hints)

### 2. Navigation Flow
- **Sequential Core Flow**: `/` → `/welcome` → `/guided-setup` → `/feature-education` → `/first-value-action` → `/retention-hook`
- **Supplemental Side Routes**: `/templates`, `/timers`, `/routing-visualizer`
- **Back Navigation**: All pages support "← Back" to previous step
- **Deep Linking**: Success states can link back to earlier steps (e.g., "Adjust a Setting")

### 3. Layout & UI Patterns
- **2-Column Desktop Layout**: Main content (left, lg:col-span-2) + Educational sidebar (right, lg:col-span-1, sticky)
- **Educational Sidebar**: Background hero image + white card overlay + video placeholder + bottom gradient quote
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable modules, collapsible panels, modals for deeper dives
- **Inline Validation**: Non-blocking hints beneath controls, no modals for simple errors

### 4. Simulated Backend Operations
- **Delays**: 2 seconds (order routing), 600ms (workbook/training), 500ms (template download), 250ms debounce (timers)
- **Toast Notifications**: Polite, 2-3 second duration, dismissible
- **Loading States**: Button text changes, spinners, disabled states during async

### 5. Accessibility Features
- **WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance**: All pages meet standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support with visible focus rings
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA live regions, proper labels, semantic headings
- **Reduced Motion**: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Touch Targets**: ≥44×44px minimum size

## Questions or Issues?

If you notice any discrepancies between PRDs and implementation:
1. Check the actual code in `/app/[route]/page.tsx`
2. Verify state in `/lib/onboarding-context.tsx`
3. Check modals in `/components/ui/`
4. Update the relevant PRD with corrections
