# PRD Update Summary - October 29, 2025

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Updated By**: AI Assistant  
**Purpose**: Capture documentation and PRD changes introduced with the new Vendors module and 7-module onboarding flow.

---

## Overview

- Onboarding flow now comprises **seven modules**, with Vendors added between Users and Routing.
- Created a dedicated PRD for the Vendors module's template-driven workflow.
- Updated existing PRDs and reference docs so triggers, numbering, and navigation align with the expanded flow.
- README and ROUTES-SUMMARY now describe the Vendors module, refreshed durations, and adjusted navigation diagrams.

---

## Files Updated

### New
- `context/features/vendors-prd.md` - documents the Vendors module intro, configuration steps, upload statuses, CX scheduling modal, and completion experience.

### Revised
- `README.md` - updated to the 7-module flow with refreshed module descriptions, durations, and project structure entries for `vendors/` routes.
- `ROUTES-SUMMARY.md` - renumbered modules, added a detailed Vendors section, adjusted hub/test-order references to 7 modules, and updated the navigation flow.
- `context/features/it-checklist-prd.md` - module number updated to 7 to reflect its new position.
- `context/features/test-order-prd.md` - trigger now references completion of Modules 1-7.
- `context/features/PRD-UPDATE-SUMMARY.md` - this summary refreshed for the October 29 update.

## Next Steps for Product & Engineering

- Align CX enablement materials (templates, training decks) with the 7-module structure.
- Decide whether to surface the `app/users/lending-groups` builder post-upload or archive it alongside other legacy flows.
- Plan analytics instrumentation for module completion once backend wiring is introduced.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Hub shows the Vendors module with 5-minute estimate and workbook workflow.
- [x] Vendor upload statuses progress Uploading -> In review -> Configured before the CTA unlocks.
- [x] Hub "All Complete" state requires 7 completed modules.
- [x] Test Order CTA remains accessible post-completion and references Modules 1â€“7.
