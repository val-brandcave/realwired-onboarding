## 2. UConnect Onboarding – Current Prototype Walkthrough

Val walks Ed through updates to the UConnect onboarding “vibe-coded” prototype:

### 2.1 Hub & Organization Setup

- **Onboarding hub** now shows:
  - Customer Success team with contact cards and quick ways to reach them.
  - Go-live context and modules.

- **Organization setup → Additional participants**
  - “Generate link” option added:
    - User can add a new participant.
    - Click “Generate link” and send via email.
  - After completing modules, user can **Review** what has been filled out:
    - High-level overview of completed pages.
    - Designed so reviewers can come back with the same credentials.

### 2.2 Definitions & Field Configuration

- Within **Definitions / Fields**:
  - All existing UConnect fields are listed.
  - Users can:
    - **Drag & drop** fields (where fields are not locked).
    - Change field **properties** (e.g., turn a field into a date picker, file upload, etc.).
    - Add a **new field** → choose field type (e.g., date picker) → add → configure:
      - Visible / required.
      - Editable / deletable.

## 3. Ed’s Feedback – Information Anxiety & UX Concerns

Ed’s overall reaction:

- “Way better than what we used to have,” **but still a lot of information anxiety.**
- Specific concerns:
  - Large, dense list of fields still feels overwhelming.
  - Adding new fields can be disorienting.
  - Notes that the **current UConnect product is even worse** (huge forever-scroll form), but still sees this as too heavy.

**Key idea:** Need to reduce cognitive load and provide stronger guardrails.

---

## 4. Breaking Complexity Into Steps & Templates

### 4.1 Overview vs Advanced Fields

- Cody proposes **splitting configuration into two steps**:
  - **Step 1:** *Overview Fields*  
  - **Step 2:** *Advanced Details*
- Ed and Val agree this is feasible and helpful.

### 4.2 Templates / Presets

Ed suggests a template-first approach:

- Show **templates** first (official Realwired presets).
- User chooses a template → then lands in a configuration screen to tweak and finish.
- Option to still **start from blank**.

Val references a similar pattern in the Bid Engagement Panel.

## 5. Improving Context & Reducing “Lost” Feeling

### 5.1 Sticky Header / Breadcrumbs

- Use a **sticky header** that changes as you scroll.
- Use **breadcrumbs** to reinforce location and purpose.

### 5.2 Read-Only Overview + Edit Mode

- Show configuration as a **read-only preview** first.
- Entering edit mode:
  - Full-screen layout.
  - Hide tutorials.
  - Reduce distractions.

---

## 6. Self-Serve Vision vs Current Hand-Holding

Ed outlines the strategic goal:

- Current onboarding is **heavily hand-held** (60-day process).
- Future: onboarding must be **self-service**.
- This prototype is an early step toward that vision.

---

## 7. Glances Onboarding – Scope Decision

Val raises Sunda’s suggestion to integrate Glances onboarding.

### Ed’s Decision: **Not Now**

Reasons:

- Glances is a **separate product**.
- OneView may replace Glances later.
- They must **focus on UConnect only** to avoid scope death.
- Platform should remain **extendable** to other products later.

### Product Discovery Instead

- Allow users to **see** other products (AI Review Forms, Reporting Microservice, etc.).
- Let users **express interest**.
- Could include promo-style blocks like Netflix discovery.

---

## 8. Hub Layout & Tabs – Onboarding, Products, Customer Success

### 8.1 Current Problem

- Too many competing elements at the top:  
  - Go-live status  
  - Modules  
  - CS team  

### 8.2 Tabbed Structure

Tabs proposed:

1. **Onboarding**  
2. **Products**  
3. **Customer Success**

### 8.3 CTA Alignment

- Move primary CTA to the **right** for balance.

---

## 9. Kanban Treatment & CS Portal Enhancements

### 9.1 Kanban View

- Onboarding modules rendered as **Kanban** in Figma.
- Ed likes the clarity.

### 9.2 CS Portal Dashboard

Val shows a draft dashboard showing:

- At-risk clients  
- Module completion funnel  
- Stuck points  
- Completed clients  

Ed approves the direction.

## 10. Delivery Paths – Figma vs Vibe-Coded Handoff

Two possible delivery paths:

### Path 1 – Traditional Handoff
- Finalize Figma → dev builds real app.

### Path 2 – Next.js Vibe-Coded Handoff
- Improve vibe-coded prototype → hand to dev → they refactor and integrate backend.

Ed finds this interesting; wants both options.

### Next Step:
- Val to send **Loom comparing both prototypes** + links.
- Ed to share with CEO and choose path.

## 11. Other Projects – OneView & Vendus Circle

  - **OneView project**
  - **Vendus Circle product**
- Need prioritization discussion.
