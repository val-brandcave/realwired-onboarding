0:01 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Hey, good afternoon.

0:03 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  How are you doing, man? Good, good.

0:05 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  How about you? Yeah, just busy, busy, busy.

0:09 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Oh, I get it. And yourself?

0:15 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  It's another Tuesday for me.

0:18 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I hear you. What are we reviewing today?

0:27 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  So, um... We're going to be reviewing some of the feedback you provided on the UConnect onboarding the other day.  Let me quickly ping Cody, see if he's joining. Okay. Thank you. Um, excuse me, I did ping in, like, I guess, like, you'll join in a moment, but why don't I go ahead and show you what have come in so far?  Yep. Awesome. So, there are a couple of things that I want to show you today, and one is on the, you know, they're all on the client hub page itself.  The first thing you'll notice is, along with the onboarding hub we have seen so far, now we have some extra additional tabs.  Oh, cool. So, the first one is going to be the products. So, we have a neat banner about what kind of products we offer that has an automatic carousel effect.  Nice. Proceeding to the set of products that we are going to offer, some of them are something that, excuse me, the client may be interesting.  Some of them, they already have because of the original onboarding. Yeah. And some of them may be coming soon just to keep the client enticed.  Yeah. They can always learn more about in, hey, Kurti. Hi, guys.

2:56 - Cody Miles
  Hey, Kurti. Hey, Ed.

3:01 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  So they could always learn more about if something they are interested in, they can open and they'll see it.  As for the tradition, we have the recall video. You can see the key features and, you know, if they already have it, they can get started and get into the onboarding of that page.  If they're interested in something new, they can click on Talk to Sales, learn more about it, and maybe show their interest.

3:22 - Cody Miles
  I just want to make sure I always reiterate, this is just the vibe-coded thing. We would design this better in Figma.  Of course. Yeah, got it.

3:34 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  So that will be the products tab. Moving on to the support tickets, this is the place where the client itself can manage their support tickets.  Either create a new ticket, give the subject, category of the priority, assign it to some of the agents, submit it.  They can see the progress, which are open, which are in progress, and dissolved.

3:57 - Cody Miles
  This is a question for you, Ed. question for the way Do do support tickets now? Is that through a third party?

4:02 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, we do advise Ndesk, you know, but this is great. We can just do an integration, so. Okay, sure.

4:12 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Yeah, I think that's what Sanda also mentioned. They can totally do an integration the other day. So, speaking of the agents or the assignees that support the onboarding, we have the CST in its own tab.  We show the agents as their information cards. They can also schedule a meeting with somebody anonymous, depending on their availability.  Or they can get into the information of each agent, look at what the activity they have done for the onboarding so far, if they have any tickets on their place.  I'm sorry, was that it? No, this is great. Okay, yeah, that concludes the part in the onboarding hub. The other thing that I wanted to show you was...  ... ... I spent some time to think of how we can make the context of the module much more clear.  The first thing you'll notice is that now we have a breakdown of whichever page, of any module we have, that the user is on right now.  The navigation is now fixed to the bottom. Oh, cool. I'll have it work out so that, you know, on the first scroll, the app kind of expects the user to scroll all the way to top to make it enabled.  So that way we know the user hasn't missed anything on the page. But, yeah, so let's finish the first module a little quick.  And in the definitions is where some of the changes you've mentioned the last time might be appearing. Which are, if user were to go into the property record, they now have the ability to select a preset template.  This doesn't currently exist on Uconnect. It is all the fields available, but we can come up with a categorization of one.  So selecting any of that will enable them to move forward. There is information about why this is and what these are.  And of course, there's going to be some thumbnail previews of what it's going to look like on Uconnect. I'm using some placeholders right now, but the original image would be more clear.  But either way, they can get into the configuration of this template and see the whole preview. For example, if they selected the commercial focus set of fields, now they essentially see what we have on the Uconnect in a much more wider view.  Yeah. And these are disabled elements. Essentially, these are the fields that they know as an example. And either they are okay with what they see and can move forward, or if they want to configure something, they click on edit configuration, which opens back into our view of editable mode.  And again, these are split into two sections. The overview fields is the first one they're going to be doing.  So just among these, they can either add a new field. So... All Yeah. Call it a multi-dropdown and place it wherever they want and configure that.  Or they could move on to the next set of fields, which is the advanced details.

7:13 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I would just say, like, you know, when you've kind of, like, navigated to this, you could probably throw away the tutorial on the side, you know, to just maximize the screen size.  Yeah. But this is great. Like, I love that.

7:30 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  I love that. Yeah, that would, you know, they can save and edit it. Now they can see the configured preview with the additional fields that have attached.  And once they're OK, they can submit and continue. It would be the same experience on the request template as well.  Seeing they can see the preview, they can edit the configuration. At any point of time, they are unsure what's happening.  They can see that it's in the edit mode. They can drag and drop. They can exit it without any changes and just confirm this.  Yes. And, yeah, take care of that module. Okay.

8:10 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, team, so I just wanted to reiterate, like, you know, I demoed this for the company on, what was it, our strategic session last week, and, like, the entire organization was just astonished, you know, not what we are building, but, like, you know, setting the new standard, and what it looks like, and what it means for the customers, you know, and it just blew everybody away.  Like, I did a little bit of a Steve Jobs kind of presentation, where I was talking about, like, us, you know, changing the organization in the shape, you know, from being a product service organization, you know, to an intelligence platform, and, you know, big part of our strategy next year is that we are onboarding, you know, additional 50 clients, you know, and everybody was, like, like, oh, is this?  Like, you know, they were, everybody was concerned about this. when we showed them this, they were just, you know, everybody's mouth.  I had a guy that was literally speechless. Like, he tried to ask 10 questions in a row, and he couldn't get through any one of them.  And so that was a phenomenal feeling. Man, that's amazing.

9:22 - Cody Miles
  Yeah, it was massive, man.

9:23 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  And then showing them the reporting microservice and what we already have. And, you know, the entire sales team was just blown away by that.  And it just was one of those moments where, you know, we got to showcase, like, all the hard work that we've written through.  And so I think we've really solidified, like, the work and the, you know, that you guys have been doing for us.  And, you know, so I don't think there's any doubt about your skills and your ability and, like, what you're producing and the value that we're creating.  And so there's so much, so many more projects for us, you know, lined up in 1026. I'm kind of, like, stoked about that.  Yeah, me too. That's amazing. Thank you for sharing that.

10:02 - Cody Miles
  No, absolutely. Yeah, so this is brilliant.

10:05 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Is there anything else that we wanted to review on this?

10:08 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  There is kind of this outstanding question.

10:10 - Cody Miles
  Yeah, I don't know if I have to tell you. Okay. My thought is, if you decide to use the Vibe Coded thing, I'm in another project with NSX right now where they're using some Vibe Coded assets, and there's a little bit of gatekeeping that's happening because, like, as product designer here, Val is not concerned about atomic theory for his front-end components, right?  And so, like, there would be all this refactoring needed by the dev team in order to ingest this and do the work.  I mean, they would at least want to do it. Whether or not you do it is up to you.

10:50 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, I found something of the similar behavior, you know, just the fact that they do want to rely on that Figma as a source of truth.  I'm from wanted to you uh, I trust Yeah. What was your experience with them in terms of the VibeCode?  Like, do you kind of, like, find something that's good, or is it, you know, does it speed up the project, or is it more about, like, do you find more, you know, blocks?  So I'll show you the exact process we're doing, if you care to see it.

11:21 - Cody Miles
  Sure. Okay. Okay. So basically, the product team is committing to a POC branch, so we have all these feature branches for, you know, POC stuff.  Whenever we're ready to merge that into dev, we raise a pull request, which is reviewed by the client. There's, like, a project manager within the client that's just reviewing it and approving it.  Then they approved the pull request, and then what Ennistax is supposed to do is ingest it, refactor it where necessary, most importantly, connect it to a backend because we're using mock data on the POC side of things.  And then they're supposed to then merge their updates back to the POC branch, and then they continue on the SDLC as normal.  So I think the way that the new world works is like no one's really figured it out yet, but so far this is working okay.  We're still fairly early on. This is my first project with Ennistax and doing this, and there was like a considerable amount of gatekeeping to the point where the client emailed all of us and said, this is what we're doing, and like we're just, we're not going to question it.  The value of it at the end of the day is the product discovery does get done a lot faster.  So like the velocity there in terms of like, we spend so much time in Figma kind of going through discovery.  And just doing it on a front-end, you know, code basis is quicker at the of the day. That's my big thing.

13:08 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Like, you know, there's, and I think it's about, like, calculating the rework, you know, because there's either rework on putting everything back into Figma.  Yeah, that's right. Or there's rework in, you know, inner stacks kind of, like, understanding, you know, how to segment this into chunkable pieces.

13:28 - Cody Miles
  Yeah.

13:29 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah, so maybe, maybe the man in the middle is the project plan, like, breaking it down into parts for them to actually consume.  Right. know, because I think, like, the big thing is, is, you know, holistically, you know, you view this project, but you're not taking care of the architecture.  Right.

13:49 - Cody Miles
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're not taking care of the architecture. And in this world, so Val has kind of been on his own island.  Yeah. Yeah. not working with the dev team on this, right? But in this world, they had an existing code base.  So we were doing the Figma stuff. And then they're like, actually, we raised funding. We got Amazon as a client.  We have to have this thing by February. How do we get there? And then the answer became, well, you can add more resources.  You can reduce scope. And then there's this other thing called Vibe Coding. And they were in on all three of those.  So what it meant for us is we then said, OK, you have an existing repo. We're going to be contributing to it.  We're going to be part of the SDLC. But they have these patterns they wanted us to follow. So we updated like a Claude MD file with like, here are the rules for Atomic Theory and just how we go about it.  There's a little bit more stricter quality concerns than there were for Val. But I mean, so far, we're doing OK.  It's working. Yeah.

14:49 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So I think if I can play that interpretation layer in the middle, I could probably set it up to be successful for InnoStacks once we did handover.  Because the way that I'm thinking about it is... play you for should for Because I most likely need to deploy you on a different project.  And if we had to redo this in Figma, then we're effectively slowing us down into kind of like the next thing.  So I think handing it over should be good to go. Yeah, I think that's the approach that we should take, yeah.

15:20 - Cody Miles
  The thing that I would want to do with Val is probably some cleanup work on our side, not just with probably the code.  But there is like UI, UX concerns I have with the Vibe-coded thing, which is fine when you're just figuring out the functional requirements.  But in a world where it's actually going to be the product, I definitely want to improve some of the UI.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

15:44 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Okay, I'm happy with that. And I mean, I think the other big thing about this project is we'll get it in piecemeal.  You know, because, you know, these modules will be deployed as... ... And, you know, the CS team kind of like work through them.  So what I really want to kind of like nail is let's nail the metaphors. You know, in other words, let's nail the patterns that is being reused.  And we can have the InnerStacks team effectively start building that core. And then every single time we have a module that needs to be put in, it's just like following that pattern and getting it done.  Right, right, right, exactly. So for me, that's kind of like the stuff that I feel like we really need to explore.  Like, I don't want to sequentially, if we now use, for example, Sundar or the CS team to sequentially go through this, it's going to take us, you know, as long as it takes them to kind of like get the knowledge up to do that.  But I think what we need to do is we need to ask which one of these patterns in these phases is not similar to the ones that we followed already.  And maybe just design those modules so that we can get a complete, you know, picture of like these methods.  Metaphors that's being used, you know, these design metaphors, and then effectively we smash that into the system. Yeah.

17:08 - Cody Miles
  Okay. Okay. So just to make sure I'm following, they would kind of build, would they adopt our code base and then just refactor, re-necessary, and create kind of the patterns out of that?  Or would they see what we've done and just kind of start from scratch but take the best of it?  Yeah. Okay.

17:32 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  What do you mean? Sorry, Cody, what do you mean by that? Maybe I don't understand. Like, you made me think about it years now.  Okay.

17:38 - Cody Miles
  And I could be asking the question in a weird way. I mean, we have a repo in Next.js, and, like, that might not even be, you know, the code base that you want for this thing, right?  So there were a whole bunch of technical decisions that were made by people who shouldn't be making technical decisions.  Yeah. Yeah.

17:57 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  That's the easy part. For me, that's the translation. You know, so the way that I kind of like see it is that this white coding solution is a, you know, it's the foundational backbone, you know, for us to build upon.  You know, Next.js is a great framework. I think what you've got here is a great framework. There's nothing there that's really like, you know, shocking me to the core.  I think it's more about like just applying structure to it, you know, and saying that I'm not looking, you know, for a specific technology stack solution here because this is not something that I need to scale to hundreds of thousands of users and I really need something that is, that's lightweight or can handle transaction volumes or whatever that is.  So the choice here is really, it's, you know, who cares? It's more, it's more about like, I think for me, it's more about like the delivery and the maintenance and the management of this, you know, you kind of like avoid things that create risk into, into your system.  Now, I don't foresee any of this, really. Like, even if we had to code freeze it for, like, six to eight months, the best that you will do is update JavaScript libraries just to pass it.  And that's fine. You know, that's very straightforward. So for me, having this in a figma as a living document, you know, having this as a vibe-coded prototype as a living document is essentially the thing that kickstarts the team.  If they want to plug out the core and plug in a different core, sure, whatever. You know, that's on them.  Okay. You I don't mind what the development process is here. For me, it's really more about, okay, I would want to, example, just tell them, like, you know, a module is an entity in our system.  And that entity, you know, has these properties and it needs to be configured this way. And just purely for the fact that as we develop more products, we will have to follow the same pattern with new products.  To put it into the system and to make that successful. So that's basically where that comes from. Cool.

20:06 - Cody Miles
  Okay. So it sounds to me then there's some work I need to do with Val just to say, okay, we're going to use the Vibe-coded POC now.  I want to clean up some UX, UI patterns. And also, like, there's some feedback today that we're going to implement.  Yeah. And probably also, like, right now there's, like, a starting screen that Val uses to say, like, here's one user flow and here's another.  We could keep that the same or we could, like, mock up some authentication screens, whatever you prefer there. Sure.  Yeah.

20:35 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I mean, the authentication screens is I really need to kind of, like, move to SSO and, you know, whatever that is.  That stuff is fundamentally doesn't change what this application is, you know. Yeah. The way that I think about it really is, you know, we now need to get it in front of the champions that's going to drive this to success.  So, for me, you know... We need to get this, not in front of Sundar. I don't think Sundar is necessarily the best person, but we need to get an owner from the CS team, you know, to kind of like carry us through the last mile.  And the way that I want to do it is, I want to effectively have a project kickoff meeting with, you know, Val, the CS team, you know, myself, and for prosperity sake, we'll add Sundar.  Then what we should be doing is, we should be saying like, okay, this is an expensive meeting. What is it that we still need to design that's needed to design elements that we haven't tackled?  And we should get this project laser focused on completing those aspects so that we can hand it over, so that the InnoStacks team can start developing on it.  And then as they finish workbooks, we can just vibe those in and plug it into the system, you know, as they become available.  And then we don't have this, oh, I need to have a big bang approach. You need to get your vibe done.  100% first before InnoStacks can take it. We can get the concurrency running and then effectively switch you guys over into a new project while that's time.  Because I've got some stuff that I need to action on.

22:14 - Cody Miles
  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So next steps then is let's schedule a call with the CX team and review the whole thing holistically.  Yeah.

22:25 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I'll ask Sana to set it up for us and to just include Vue. But I think, like I said, that's what we need to do.  We need to drive this to ownership now. It's out of prototype phase. You know, I think we smashed that and that's been very successful.  And, you know, now, like for us to worry if that button should be red or green is not really going to drive, you know, changes into the fundamentals.  So let's just switch gears here and get this from prototype to implementation. Yeah.

22:50 - Cody Miles
  Awesome. Okay, cool.

22:52 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Sweet. Anything else from your side that we need to manage and smash through? you. Tom?

22:59 - Cody Miles
  Do you think... None for me, guys. What happened to that dashboard overview?

23:03 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  I know you said you wanted to rethink that page into making it a little bit more easier. I know you showed me something to that degree last week.  Sander mentioned something in that sense as well.

23:15 - Cody Miles
  You're talking about in the Vibe Coded app. So in Figma, we have a different version of this page where it's actually in a Kanban.  So your modules are all different. Yeah, if you can pull that up, Val. That was like, that's us trying to figure out what's the best user experience of this page in a world where the final deliverable is Figma.  But if we decided that actually we really like the Kanban idea, we can actually just implement that here in the Vibe Coded.

23:42 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Yeah, how do we make that decision?

23:44 - Cody Miles
  Well, I think, you know, effectively, I've heard a decision today that the Vibe Coded POC is the deliverable. So the things I was punting to Figma, I now want to pull back into here.  Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah, don't think so much time.

24:00 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  On that, like, let's get this a living, breathing thing. You know why I love that is also I can kind of immediately give it to the executive team and the CS team and, you know, they start giving me feedback immediately on it, you know.  So we kind of like walk in that circle, you know, dramatically.

24:15 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Yeah, for sure.

24:16 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah.

24:17 - Cody Miles
  So I want to do that.

24:19 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So let's, if we can smash that through and make those changes, that would be wonderful. Okay. Because I want to, I want to, are you guys taking vacation over December?  December, what's the, what's the game?

24:31 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  There's no rest for the wicked man.

24:33 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah. That's how I know I'm evil, Cody. Yeah.

24:41 - Cody Miles
  I mean, Val is obviously going to be taken off for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and then New Year's and New Year's Day.  Okay. So, yeah. So just the standard holidays.

24:51 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Yeah.

24:52 - Cody Miles
  Okay. Cool. Yeah.

24:53 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  So what I want to do is I want to make sure that there's work for you guys, you know, to smash through.  Um. Let's see. see. Um, Because it slows down on our side. Like, I will be available for any questions and quick meetings and  like that.  But our clients slow down, so we slow down as well. Yeah, sure.

25:13 - Cody Miles
  In our last call, we said, hey, we need to talk about the next projects. And then we ran out of time.  And we're coming up at that point today, too. Yeah, the big one, I think the big one that I just quickly wanted to mention is Vendor Circle.

25:27 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Well, you know, boys, you know what we did is we started creating a new standard for how things should look and feel.  And now we're launching projects and we're not following the standard. And so I shot myself in the foot here with this reporting microservice and this onboarding project because everybody just expects this quality now.  The long and the short is that the Vendor Circle project, the one that I have currently is far from it.  It looks very much similar to Uconnect. You know, it's very... It's it's cumbersome,  ton of field, information anxiety, overload, you know, you can imagine it.  Sure. So a big thing of what I want to do there is really just rethink that UI to make it a little bit smoother.  I don't want to delay the launch, you know, I effectively am just looking for some front-end changes that I can do quickly.  So that's the first phase. There is a part of that project that I believe is a community-based project. And I would want to talk to you about that in detail because, you know, creating a community around something is hard.  And I kind of want to do a demo and a prototype around, like, what should it look like, what should it feel like, so that we can test it in the market.  But the first phase is really just, like, let's just reduce the information anxiety. And so I do want to kind of, like, kick that off because I'm trying to launch that project, you know, within the first quarter.  You know, January somewhere. So if we can kind of like start pushing this work to a conclusion, it frees me up for you guys to pull into that project.  And that would be the next one.

27:14 - Cody Miles
  Cool. So yeah, so give us a couple of days to kind of refactor the VibeCoded thing and get that into handoff state, get you access to the repo and all the normal stuff.  What would be the best way for us to get onboarded onto the Vendor Circle project?

27:29 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  We can just schedule a demo, you know, with Sanna and Jason and walk you through it. And then I can walk you through, you know, my views on it as well.  So maybe we can just do that as one meeting. Whenever you are ready to have that, I can all, I can record it for you, but I can also do that.  I can record it and just throw it over the fence if you think that that's a little bit easier.

27:56 - Cody Miles
  What I would like to do, if we can make it happen, would be that meeting would happen this week.  So that Val and I have that kind of on deck and ready to go. So if we can figure out availability Thursday or Friday, definitely.  Yeah, let me get on top of that and I can get that moving.

28:12 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Awesome. Okay, great.

28:15 - Cody Miles
  Awesome, bud.

28:17 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  All right, thanks, Ed.

28:18 - Cody Miles
  Yeah, sorry it's always so short.

28:20 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  But hey, Cody, if you're giving out bonuses, Val deserves one, man. He does deserve one.

28:26 - Cody Miles
  Thank you, Yeah. You're welcome. All right, Ed, shut your mouth, okay? Get out of here. Okay, bye.

28:36 - Edward Kruger (Realwired)
  Bye. Bye. Bye.

28:39 - Val Vinnakota (brandcave.co)
  Bye. Bye.
