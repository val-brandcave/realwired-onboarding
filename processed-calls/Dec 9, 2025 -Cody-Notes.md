## Vibe Coded Onboarding App

- Home
    - [The “On Track” pill should be next to the date label](https://loom.com/i/d127853923dd44c1987c30567966c3a5)(public/on-track.png)
- Details / Wizard Steps
    - (General) The header should include the page title you’re working on so the user never loses context on what they’re working on.
        - [Add breadcrumbs right here.](https://loom.com/i/4ea127abe42a4823b0e99d0170de7a20)(public/breadcrumbs-position.png)
    - [Property Management](https://loom.com/i/6156d4ff954447b79c3a485b9591c5ad)(public/property-configuration.png)
        - We need to make it more clear you can click on the property to open the drawer and edit the property
        - We need to break definitions into multiple steps, possibly. Ed says there’s still too much going on.
            - Break Advanced Details and Overview into two separate actions
            - Ed wants the default view of this to be a read-only preview state, where the user can see the information easily. No sidebar.
                - Then the user can select an Edit action to enter into an edit state, see the sidebar, etc.
        - Add the ability to see a grid of presets / templates, and preview what the forms look like, and then be able to select a template and move onto this current screens to more granularly define the fields.
- Onboarding onto Glances
    - Ed said onboarding should be entirely different here than in YouConnect
- Hub
    - Tab 1: Onboarding
    - Tab 2: Products
        - Ed said this could also be a tab or something on the hub that shows all of the available products and which ones are activated. And if they’re not activated, allow the user to watch a video and learn more.
    - Tab 3: Customer Success
        - Move the customer success people to this tab.
