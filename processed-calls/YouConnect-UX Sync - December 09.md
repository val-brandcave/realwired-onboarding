# UX Sync – Realwired (December 09)

- **Date**: December 09  
- **Duration**: ~32 minutes  
- **Participants**: Cody Miles (Boss), Val Vinnakota (Brandcave), Ed (Realwired)  
- **Recording**: https://fathom.video/share/yf2WSTdUkcsevo7j6xz28QNUEPCNdmxM

## Purpose
Review the vibe-coded UConnect onboarding prototype with Ed, gather UX feedback, and align on scope/priorities for the next iteration.

## What we showed
- **Hub & Org setup**: CS contact cards, go-live context, modules, add participant via “Generate link,” post-completion review mode.
- **Definitions / Fields**: List of all UConnect fields with drag/drop, relabel, input type change, add-new-field with required/visible/editable toggles.
- **CS Portal**: Early dashboard concepts (at-risk clients, funnels, stuck points, completed clients).

## Ed’s feedback (pain/concerns)
- Overall better, but **information anxiety** remains: long dense field lists; adding fields feels disorienting.
- Current product is worse, but this still feels heavy—needs clearer guardrails and progressive disclosure.

## Direction agreed
- **Two-step field configuration**: Step 1 Overview fields, Step 2 Advanced details.
- **Template-first entry**: Show official Realwired presets first; allow tweak/finish; still permit start-from-blank.
- **Guidance/wayfinding**: Sticky header + breadcrumbs; start with read-only preview then enter full-screen edit mode (hide tutorials to reduce clutter).
- **Hub structure**: Tabs (Onboarding / Products / Customer Success); move primary CTA to the right for balance.
- **Discovery instead of scope creep**: Do **not** fold in Glances now; keep extendable but focus on UConnect. Offer product discovery tiles (AI Review Forms, Reporting, etc.) with “express interest” toggles.
- **Delivery options**: Keep both paths open—(1) polished Figma handoff, (2) improved Next.js vibe-coded handoff. Val to send Loom comparing both.

## Decisions / Scope calls
- No Glances onboarding right now (avoid scope death); OneView may replace later.
- Keep platform extendable for future products; surface discovery/interest only.
- Proceed with UX simplifications (templates, two-step fields, breadcrumbs, preview→edit flow).

## Action items
- **Val**
  - Redesign Fields configuration into **Overview vs Advanced** steps with clearer guardrails.
  - Add **template-first** entry (Realwired presets) + blank option; then allow tweaks.
  - Implement **sticky header/breadcrumbs**, **read-only preview → full-screen edit** mode that hides tutorials when editing.
  - Update **hub layout** to tabs (Onboarding / Products / CS) and right-align primary CTA.
  - Add **product discovery** tiles with “express interest” toggles (AI Review Forms, Reporting microservice, etc.).
  - Prepare and send **Loom** comparing Figma vs vibe-coded paths + links for Ed/CEO review.
  - Extend CS Portal dashboard concepts (funnels, risk indicators, stuck points) per Ed’s approval.
- **Cody**
  - Support decision framing with Ed/CEO once Loom/options are shared.
- **Ed**
  - Review Loom and choose delivery path (Figma vs vibe-coded refactor/integrate).
  - Provide any must-have presets/templates to seed the template-first flow.

## Opportunities / Notes
- Reduce cognitive load with default presets + progressive disclosure.
- Use discovery tiles to promote adjacent products without expanding scope.
- Full-screen edit mode can streamline focus and lower perceived complexity.
- Kanban treatment for onboarding modules was liked—keep and polish.
